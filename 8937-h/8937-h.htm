    <p>
      My daughter again applies to me for my paternal <i>imprimatur</i>; and I

      she requires.

      To excite the rising generation to depend upon their own exertions for
      success in life is surely a laudable endeavour; but, while the young mind
      is cautioned against dependence on the patronage of the great, and of
      office, it is encouraged to rely upon such friends as may be acquired by
      personal merit, good manners, and good conduct.

    <h2>
      PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The public has called for a third <i>impression</i> of this book; it was,
      therefore, the duty of the author to take advantage of the corrections
      which have been communicated to her by private friends and public censors.
      Whatever she has thought liable to just censure has in the present edition
      been amended, as far as is consistent with the identity of the story. It
      is remarkable that several incidents which have been objected to as
      impossible or improbable were true. For instance, the medical case, in
      Chapter XIX.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bishop was really saved from suffocation by a clergyman in his diocese
      (no matter where or when), in the manner represented in Chapter X. The
      bishop died long ago; and he never was an epicure. A considerable estate
      was about seventy years ago regained, as described in Chapter XLII., by
      the discovery of a sixpence under the seal of a deed, which had been
      coined later than the date of the deed. Whether it be advantageous or
      prudent to introduce such singular facts in a fictitious history is a
      separate consideration, which might lead to a discussion too long for the
      present occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      On some other points of more importance to the writer, it is necessary
      here to add a few words. It has been supposed that some parts of PATRONAGE
      were not written by Miss Edgeworth. This is not fact: the whole of these
      volumes were written by her, the opinions they contain are her own, and
      she is answerable for all the faults which may be found in them. Of
      ignorance of law, and medicine, and of diplomacy, she pleads guilty; and
      of making any vain or absurd pretensions to legal or medical learning, she
      hopes, by candid judges, to be acquitted. If in the letters and history of
      her lawyer and physician she has sometimes introduced technical phrases,
      it was done merely to give, as far as she could, the colour of reality to
      her fictitious personages. To fulfil the main purpose of her story it was
      essential only to show how some lawyers and physicians may be pushed
      forward for a time, without much knowledge either of law or medicine; or
      how, on the contrary, others may, independently of patronage, advance
      themselves permanently by their own merit. If this principal object of the
      fiction be accomplished, the author's ignorance on professional subjects
      is of little consequence to the moral or interest of the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the charge of having drawn satirical portraits, she has already
      disclaimed all personality, and all intention of satirizing any
      profession; and she is grieved to find it necessary to repel such a
      charge. The author of a slight work of fiction may, however, be consoled
      for any unjust imputation of personal satire, by reflecting, that even the
      grave and impartial historian cannot always escape similar suspicion.
      Tacitus says that "there must always be men, who, from congenial manners,
      and sympathy in vice, will think the fidelity of history a satire on
      themselves; and even the praise due to virtue is sure to give umbrage."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "How the wind is rising!" said Rosamond.&mdash;"God help the poor people
      at sea to-night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother Godfrey smiled.&mdash;"One would think," said he, "that she
      had an argosy of lovers at sea, uninsured."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You gentlemen," replied Rosamond, "imagine that ladies are always
      thinking of lovers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not <i>always</i>," said Godfrey; "only when they show themselves
      particularly disposed to humanity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My humanity, on the present occasion, cannot even be suspected," said
      Rosamond; "for you know, alas! that I have no lover at sea or land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But a shipwreck might bless the lucky shore with some rich waif," said
      Godfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Waifs and strays belong to the lady of the manor," said Rosamond; "and I
      have no claim to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother would, I dare say, make over her right to you," said Godfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that would do me no good," said Rosamond; "for here is Caroline, with
      superior claims of every sort, and with that most undisputed of all the
      rights of woman&mdash;beauty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True: but Caroline would never accept of stray hearts," said Godfrey.
      "See how her lip curls with pride at the bare imagination!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pride never curled Caroline's lip," cried Rosamond: "besides, pride is
      very becoming to a woman. No woman can be good for much without it, can
      she, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before you fly off, Rosamond, to my mother as to an ally, whom you are
      sure I cannot resist," said Godfrey, "settle first whether you mean to
      defend Caroline upon the ground of her having or not having pride."
    </p>
    <p>
      A fresh gust of wind rose at this moment, and Rosamond listened to it
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seriously, Godfrey," said she, "do you remember the ship-wrecks last
      winter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, Rosamond went to one of the windows, and opened the shutter.
      Her sister Caroline followed, and they looked out in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see a light to the left of the beacon," said Caroline.&mdash;"I never
      saw a light there before&mdash;What can it mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only some fishermen," said Godfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, brother, it is quite a storm," persisted Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only equinoctial gales, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only equinoctial gales! But to drowning people it would be no comfort
      that they were shipwrecked only by equinoctial gales. There! there! what
      do you think of that blast?" cried Rosamond; "is not there some danger
      now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Godfrey will not allow it," said Mrs. Percy: "he is a soldier, and it is
      his trade not to know fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Show him a <i>certain</i> danger," cried Mr. Percy, looking up from a
      letter he was writing,&mdash;"show him a <i>certain</i> danger, and he
      will feel fear as much as the greatest coward of you all. Ha! upon my
      word, it is an <i>ugly</i> night," continued he, going to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear father!" cried Rosamond, "did you see that light&mdash;out at
      sea?&mdash;There! there!&mdash;to the left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the east&mdash;I see it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hark! did you hear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Minute guns!" said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dead silence instantly.&mdash;Every body listened.&mdash;Guns
      were heard again.&mdash;The signal of some vessel in distress. The sound
      seemed near the shore.&mdash;Mr. Percy and Godfrey hastened immediately to
      the coast.&mdash;Their servants and some people from the neighbouring
      village, whom they summoned, quickly followed. They found that a vessel
      had struck upon a rock, and from the redoubled signals it appeared that
      the danger must be imminent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boatmen, who were just wakened, were surly, and swore that they would
      not stir; that whoever she was, she might weather out the night, for that,
      till daybreak, they couldn't get alongside of her. Godfrey instantly
      jumped into a boat, declaring he would go out directly at all hazards.&mdash;Mr.
      Percy with as much intrepidity, but, as became his age, with more
      prudence, provided whatever assistance was necessary from the villagers,
      who declared they would go any where with him; the boatmen, then ashamed,
      or afraid of losing the offered reward, pushed aside the <i>land lubbers</i>,
      and were ready to put out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out they rowed&mdash;and they were soon so near the vessel, that they
      could hear the cries and voices of the crew. The boats hailed her, and she
      answered that she was Dutch, homeward bound&mdash;had mistaken the lights
      upon the coast&mdash;had struck on a rock&mdash;was filling with water&mdash;and
      must go down in half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment the boats came alongside of her, the crew crowded into them so
      fast, and with such disorder and precipitation, that they were in great
      danger of being overset, which, Mr. Percy seeing, called out in a loud and
      commanding voice to stop several who were in the act of coming down the
      ship's side, and promised to return for them if they would wait. But just
      as he gave the order for his boatmen to <i>push off</i>, a French voice
      called out "Monsieur!&mdash;Monsieur l'Anglois!&mdash;one moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy looked back and saw, as the moon shone full upon the wreck, a
      figure standing at the poop, leaning over with out-stretched arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am Monsieur de Tourville, monsieur&mdash;a chargé d'affaires&mdash;with
      papers of the greatest importance&mdash;despatches."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will return for you, sir&mdash;it is impossible for me to take you now&mdash;our
      boat is loaded as much as it can bear," cried Mr. Percy; and he repeated
      his order to the boatmen to <i>push off</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Godfrey and Mr. Percy were trimming the boat, M. de Tourville made
      an effort to jump into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! don't do it, sir!" cried a woman with a child in her arms; "the
      gentleman will come back for us: for God's sake, don't jump into it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't attempt it, sir," cried Mr. Percy, looking up, "or you'll sink us
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Tourville threw down the poor woman who tried to stop him, and he
      leaped from the side of the ship. At the same moment Mr. Percy, seizing an
      oar, pushed the boat off, and saved it from being overset, as it must have
      been if M. de Tourville had scrambled into it. He fell into the water. Mr.
      Percy, without waiting to see the event, went off as fast as possible,
      justly considering that the lives of the number he had under his
      protection, including his son's and his own, were not to be sacrificed for
      one man, whatever his name or office might be, especially when that man
      had persisted against all warning in his rash selfishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At imminent danger to themselves, Mr. Percy and Godfrey, after landing
      those in the boat, returned once more to the wreck; and though they both
      declared that their consciences would be at ease even if they found that
      M. de Tourville was drowned, yet it was evident that they rejoiced to see
      him safe on board. This time the boat held him, and all the rest of his
      fellow sufferers; and Mr. Percy and his son had the satisfaction of
      bringing every soul safely to shore.&mdash;M. de Tourville, as soon as he
      found himself on terra firma, joined with all around him in warm thanks to
      Mr. Percy and his son, by whom their lives had been saved.&mdash;Godfrey
      undertook to find lodgings for some of the passengers and for the ship's
      crew in the village, and Mr. Percy invited the captain, M. de Tourville,
      and the rest of the passengers, to Percy-hall, where Mrs. Percy and her
      daughters had prepared every thing for their hospitable reception. When
      they had warmed, dried, and refreshed themselves, they were left to enjoy
      what they wanted most&mdash;repose. The Percy family, nearly as much
      fatigued as their guests, were also glad to rest&mdash;all but Rosamond,
      who was wide awake, and so much excited by what had happened, that she
      continued talking to her sister, who slept in the same room with her, of
      every circumstance, and filling her imagination with all that might come
      to pass from the adventures of the night, whilst Caroline, too sleepy to
      be able to answer judiciously, or even plausibly, said, "Yes," "No," and
      "Very true," in the wrong place; and at length, incapable of uttering even
      a monosyllable, was reduced to inarticulate sounds in sign of attention.
      These grew fainter and fainter, and after long intervals absolutely
      failing, Rosamond with some surprise and indignation, exclaimed, "I do
      believe, Caroline, you are asleep!" And, in despair, Rosamond, for want of
      an auditor, was compelled to compose herself to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a few hours the storm abated, and in the morning, when
      the family and their shipwrecked guests assembled at breakfast, all was
      calm and serene. Much to Rosamond's dissatisfaction, M. de Tourville did
      not make his appearance. Of the other strangers she had seen only a
      glimpse the preceding night, and had not settled her curiosity concerning
      what sort of beings they were. On a clear view by daylight of the
      personages who now sat at the breakfast-table, there did not appear much
      to interest her romantic imagination, or to excite her benevolent
      sympathy. They had the appearance of careful money-making men, thick,
      square-built Dutch merchants, who said little and eat much&mdash;butter
      especially. With one accord, as soon as they had breakfasted, they rose,
      and begged permission to go down to the wreck to look after their
      property. Mr. Percy and Godfrey offered immediately to accompany them to
      the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy had taken the precaution to set guards to watch all night, from
      the time he left the vessel, that no depredations might be committed. They
      found that some of the cargo had been damaged by the sea-water, but
      excepting this loss there was no other of any consequence; the best part
      of the goods was perfectly safe. As it was found that it would take some
      time to repair the wreck, the Prussian and Hamburgh passengers determined
      to go on board a vessel which was to sail from a neighbouring port with
      the first fair wind. They came, previously to their departure, to thank
      the Percy family, and to assure them that their hospitality would never be
      forgotten.&mdash;Mr. Percy pressed them to stay at Percy-hall till the
      vessel should sail, and till the captain should send notice of the first
      change of wind.&mdash;This offer, however, was declined, and the Dutch
      merchants, with due acknowledgments, said, by their speaking partner, that
      "they considered it safest and best to go with the goods, and so wished
      Mr. Percy a good morning, and that he might prosper in all his dealings;
      and, sir," concluded he, "in any of the changes of fortune, which happen
      to men by land as well as by sea, please to remember the names of
      Grinderweld, Groensvelt, and Slidderchild of Amsterdam, or our
      correspondents, Panton and Co., London."
    </p>
    <p>
      So having said, they walked away, keeping an eye upon the goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Percy returned home it was near dinner-time, yet M. de Tourville
      had not made his appearance. He was all this while indulging in a
      comfortable sleep. He had no goods on board the wreck except his clothes,
      and as these were in certain trunks and portmanteaus in which Comtois, his
      valet, had a joint concern, M. de Tourville securely trusted that they
      would be obtained without his taking any trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comtois and the trunks again appeared, and a few minutes before dinner M.
      de Tourville made his entrance into the drawing-room, no longer in the
      plight of a shipwrecked mariner, but in gallant trim, wafting gales of
      momentary bliss as he went round the room paying his compliments to the
      ladies, bowing, smiling, apologizing,&mdash;the very pink of courtesy!&mdash;The
      gentlemen of the family, who had seen him the preceding night in his
      frightened, angry, drenched, and miserable state, could scarcely believe
      him to be the same person.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Frenchman, it will be allowed, can contrive to say more, and to tell
      more of his private history in a given time, than could be accomplished by
      a person of any other nation. In the few minutes before dinner he found
      means to inform the company, that he was private secretary and favourite
      of the minister of a certain German court. To account for his having taken
      his passage in a Dutch merchant vessel, and for his appearing without a
      suitable suite, he whispered that he had been instructed to preserve a
      strict incognito, from which, indeed, nothing but the horrors of the
      preceding night could have drawn him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was served, and at dinner M. de Tourville was seen, according to
      the polished forms of society, humbling himself in all the hypocrisy of
      politeness; with ascetic good-breeding, preferring every creature's ease
      and convenience to his own, practising a continual system of self-denial,
      such as almost implied a total annihilation of self-interest and
      self-love. All this was strikingly contrasted with the selfishness which
      he had recently betrayed, when he was in personal danger. Yet the
      influence of polite manners prevailed so far as to make his former conduct
      be forgotten by most of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, when the ladies retired, in the female privy council held to
      discuss the merits of the absent gentlemen, Rosamond spoke first, and
      during the course of five minutes pronounced as many contradictory
      opinions of M. de Tourville, as could well be enunciated in the same space
      of time.&mdash;At last she paused, and her mother smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand your smile, mother," said Rosamond; "but the reason I appear
      a <i>little</i> to contradict myself sometimes in my judgment of character
      is, because I speak my thoughts just as they rise in my mind, while
      persons who have a character for judgment to support always keep the
      changes of their opinion snug to themselves, never showing the items of
      the account on either side, and let you see nothing but their balance.&mdash;This
      is very grand, and, if their balance be right, very glorious.&mdash;But
      ignominious as my mode of proceeding may seem, exposing me to the rebukes,
      derision, uplifted hands and eyes of my auditors, yet exactly because I am
      checked at every little mistake I make in my accounts, the chance is in my
      favour that my totals should at last be right, and my balance perfectly
      accurate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true, my dear: as long as you choose for your auditors only your
      friends, you are wise; but you sometimes lay your accounts open to
      strangers; and as they see only your errors, without ever coming to your
      conclusion, they form no favourable opinion of your accuracy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind what strangers think of me&mdash;much," said Rosamond.&mdash;"At
      least you will allow, mamma, that I have reason to be satisfied, if only
      those who do not know me should form an unfavourable opinion of my
      judgment&mdash;and, after all, ma'am, of the two classes of people, those
      who 'never said a foolish thing, and never did a wise one,' and those who
      never did a foolish thing, and never said a wise one, would not you rather
      that I should belong to the latter class?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, if I were reduced to the cruel alternative: but is there an
      unavoidable necessity for your belonging to either class?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will consider of it, ma'am," said Rosamond: "in the meantime, Caroline,
      you will allow that M. de Tourville is very agreeable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Agreeable!" repeated Caroline; "such a selfish being? Have you forgotten
      his attempting to jump into the boat, at the hazard of oversetting it, and
      of drowning my father and Godfrey, who went out to save him&mdash;and when
      my father warned him&mdash;and promised to return for him&mdash;selfish,
      cowardly creature!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! poor man, he was so frightened, that he did not know what he was
      doing&mdash;he was not himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean he was himself," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very ungrateful, Caroline," cried Rosamond; "for I am sure M. de
      Tourville admires you extremely&mdash;yes, in spite of that provoking,
      incredulous smile, I say he does admire you exceedingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if he did," replied Caroline, "that would make no difference in my
      opinion of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt <i>that</i>," said Rosamond: "I know a person's admiring me would
      make a great difference in my opinion of his taste and judgment&mdash;and
      how much more if he had sense enough to admire you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond paused, and stood for some minutes silent in reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will never do, my dear," said Mrs. Percy, looking up at her; "trust me
      it will never do; turn him which way you will in your imagination, you
      will never make a hero of him&mdash;nor yet a brother-in-law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear mother, how could you guess what I was thinking of?" said
      Rosamond, colouring a little, and laughing; "but I assure you&mdash;now
      let me explain to you, ma'am, in one word, what I think of M. de
      Tourville."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! my dear, he is here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen came into the room to tea.&mdash;M. de Tourville walked to
      the table at which Mrs. Percy was sitting; and, after various compliments
      on the beauty of the views from the windows, on the richness of the
      foliage in the park, and the superiority of English verdure, he next
      turned to look at the pictures in the saloon, distinguished a portrait by
      Sir Joshua Reynolds, then passing to a table on which lay several books&mdash;"Is
      it permitted?" said he, taking up one of them&mdash;the Life of Lord
      Nelson.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Tourville did not miss the opportunity of paying a just and what to
      English ears he knew must be a delightful, tribute of praise to our naval
      hero. Then opening several other books, he made a rash attempt to
      pronounce in English their titles, and with the happy facility of a
      Frenchman, he touched upon various subjects, dwelt upon none, but found
      means on all to say something to raise himself and his country in the
      opinion of the company, and at the same time to make all his auditors
      pleased with themselves. Presently, taking a seat between Rosamond and
      Caroline, he applied himself to draw out their talents for conversation.
      Nor did he labour in vain. They did not shut themselves up in stupid and
      provoking silence, nor did they make any ostentatious display of their
      knowledge or abilities.&mdash;M. de Tourville, as Rosamond had justly
      observed, seemed to be particularly struck with Miss Caroline Percy.&mdash;She
      was beautiful, and of an uncommon style of beauty. Ingenuous, unaffected,
      and with all the simplicity of youth, there was a certain dignity and
      graceful self-possession in her manner, which gave the idea of a superior
      character. She had, perhaps, less of what the French call <i>esprit</i>
      than M. de Tourville had been accustomed to meet with in young persons on
      the continent, but he was the more surprised by the strength and justness
      of thought which appeared in her plain replies to the <i>finesse</i> of
      some of his questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning of the second day that he was at Percy-hall, M. de Tourville
      was admiring the Miss Percys' drawings, especially some miniatures of
      Caroline's, and he produced his snuff-box, to show Mr. Percy a beautiful
      miniature on its lid.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was exquisitely painted. M. de Tourville offered it to Caroline to
      copy, and Mrs. Percy urged her to make the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the celebrated Euphrosyne," said he, "who from the stage was very
      near mounting a throne."
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Tourville left the miniature in the hands of the ladies to be
      admired, and, addressing himself to Mr. Percy, began to tell with much
      mystery the story of Euphrosyne. She was an actress of whom the prince,
      heir apparent at the <i>German court</i> where he resided, had become
      violently enamoured. One of the prince's young confidants had assisted his
      royal highness in carrying on a secret correspondence with Euphrosyne,
      which she managed so artfully that the prince was on the point of giving
      her a written promise of marriage, when the intrigue was discovered, and
      prevented from proceeding farther, by a certain Count Albert Altenberg, a
      young nobleman who had till that moment been one of the prince's
      favourites, but who by thus opposing his passion lost entirely his
      prince's favour. The story was a common story of an intrigue, such as
      happens every day in every country where there is a young prince; but
      there was something uncommon in the conduct of Count Altenberg. Mr. Percy
      expressed his admiration of it; but M. de Tourville, though he
      acknowledged, as in morality bound, that the count's conduct had been
      admirable, just what it ought to be upon this occasion, yet spoke of him
      altogether as <i>une tête exaltée</i>, a young man of a romantic Quixotic
      enthusiasm, to which he had sacrificed the interests of his family, and
      his own hopes of advancement at court. In support of this opinion, M. de
      Tourville related several anecdotes, and on each of these anecdotes Mr.
      Percy and M. de Tourville differed in opinion. All that was produced to
      prove that the young count had no judgment or discretion appeared to Mr.
      Percy proofs of his independence of character and greatness of soul. Mr.
      Percy repeated the anecdotes to Mrs. Percy and his daughters; and M. de
      Tourville, as soon as he saw that the ladies, and especially Caroline,
      differed from him, immediately endeavoured to slide round to their
      opinion, and assured Caroline, with many asseverations, and with his hand
      upon his heart, that he had merely been speaking of the light in which
      these things appeared to the generality of men of the world; that for his
      own particular feelings they were all in favour of the frankness and
      generosity of character evinced by these imprudences&mdash;he only
      lamented that certain qualities should expose their possessor to the
      censure and ridicule of those who were like half the world, incapable of
      being moved by any motive but interest, and unable to reach to the idea of
      the moral sublime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more M. de Tourville said upon the subject, and the more gesture and
      emphasis he used to impress the belief in his truth, the less Caroline
      believed him, and the more dislike and contempt she felt for the duplicity
      and pitiful meanness of a character, which was always endeavouring to
      seem, instead of to be.&mdash;He understood and felt the expression of her
      countenance, and mortified by that dignified silence, which said more than
      words could express, he turned away, and never afterwards addressed to her
      any of his <i>confidential</i> conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this moment Rosamond's opinion of M. de Tourville changed. She gave
      him up altogether, and denied, or at least gave him grudgingly, that
      praise, which he eminently deserved for agreeable manners and
      conversational talents. Not a foible of his now escaped her quick
      observation and her lively perception of ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether from accident, or from some suspicion that he had lost ground with
      the ladies, M. de Tourville the next day directed the principal part of
      his conversation to the gentlemen of the family: comforting himself with
      the importance of his political and official character, he talked grandly
      of politics and diplomacy. Rosamond, who listened with an air of arch
      attention, from time to time, with a tone of ironical simplicity, asked
      explanations on certain points relative to the diplomatic code of
      morality, and professed herself much edified and enlightened by the
      answers she received.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wished, as she told Caroline, that some one would write Advice to
      Diplomatists, in the manner of Swift's advice to Servants; and she
      observed that M. de Tourville, chargé d'affaires, &amp;c., might supply
      anecdotes illustrative, and might embellish the work with a portrait of a
      finished diplomatist. Unfortunately for the public, on the third morning
      of the diplomatist's visit, a circumstance occurred, which prevented the
      farther development of his character, stopped his flow of anecdote, and
      snatched him from the company of his hospitable hosts. In looking over his
      papers, in order to show Mr. Percy a complimentary letter from some
      crowned head, M. de Tourville discovered that an important packet of
      papers belonging to his despatches was missing. He had in the moment of
      danger and terror stuffed all his despatches into his great-coat pocket;
      in getting out of the boat he had given his coat to Comtois to carry, and,
      strange to tell, this chargé d'affaires had taken it upon trust, from the
      assertion of his valet, that all his papers were safe. He once, indeed,
      had looked them over, but so carelessly that he never had missed the
      packet. His dismay was great when he discovered his loss. He repeated at
      least a thousand times that he was an undone man, unless the packet could
      be found.&mdash;Search was made for it, in the boat, on the shore, in
      every probable and improbable place&mdash;but all in vain; and in the
      midst of the search a messenger came to announce that the wind was fair,
      that the ship would sail in one hour, and that the captain could wait for
      no man. M. de Tourville was obliged to take his departure without this
      precious packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Percy was the only person in the family who had the humanity to pity
      him. He was too little of a soldier for Godfrey's taste, too much of a
      courtier for Mr. Percy, too frivolous for Caroline, and too little
      romantic for Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So," said Rosamond, "here was a fine beginning of a romance with a
      shipwreck, that ends only in five square merchants, who do not lose even a
      guilder of their property, and a diplomatist, with whom we are sure of
      nothing but that he has lost a bundle of papers for which nobody cares!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few days the remembrance of the whole adventure began to fade from
      her fancy. M. de Tourville, and his snuff-box, and his essences, and his
      flattery, and his diplomacy, and his lost packet, and all the
      circumstances of the shipwreck, would have appeared as a dream, if they
      had not been maintained in the rank of realities by the daily sight of the
      wreck, and by the actual presence of the Dutch sailors, who were repairing
      the vessel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few days after the departure of M. de Tourville, Commissioner Falconer,
      a friend, or at least a relation of Mr. Percy's, came to pay him a visit.
      As the commissioner looked out of the window and observed the Dutch
      carpenter, who was passing by with tools under his arm, he began to talk
      of the late shipwreck. Mr. Falconer said he had heard much of the
      successful exertions and hospitality of the Percy family on that occasion&mdash;regretted
      that he had himself been called to town just at that time&mdash;asked many
      questions about the passengers on board the vessel, and when M. de
      Tourville was described to him, deplored that Mr. Percy had never thought
      of trying to detain this foreigner a few days longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, argued the commissioner, though M. de Tourville might not be an
      accredited chargé d'affaires, yet, since he was a person in some degree in
      an official capacity, and intrusted with secret negotiations, government
      might have wished to know something about him. "And at all events," added
      the commissioner, with a shrewd smile, "it would have been a fine way of
      paying our court to a certain great man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, commissioner, you still put your trust in great men?" said Mr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in all great men, but in some," replied the commissioner; "for
      instance, in your old friend, Lord Oldborough, who, I'm happy to inform
      you, is just come into our neighbourhood to Clermont-park, of which he has
      at last completed the purchase, and has sent down his plate and pictures.&mdash;Who
      knows but he may make Clermont-park his summer residence, instead of his
      place in Essex? and if he should, there's no saying of what advantage it
      might be, for I have it from the very best authority, that his lordship's
      influence in <i>a certain quarter</i> is greater than ever. Of course, Mr.
      Percy, you will wait upon Lord Oldborough, when he comes to this part of
      the country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I believe not," said Mr. Percy: "I have no connexion with him now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you were so intimate with him abroad," expostulated Mr. Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is five-and-twenty years since I knew him abroad," said Mr. Percy;
      "and from all I have heard, he is an altered man. When I was intimate with
      Lord Oldborough, he was a generous, open-hearted youth: he has since
      become a politician, and I fear he has sold himself for a riband to the
      demon of ambition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter to whom he has sold himself, or for what," replied the
      commissioner; "that is his affair, not ours. We must not be too nice. He
      is well disposed towards you; and, my dear sir, I should take it as a very
      particular favour if you would introduce me to his lordship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With great pleasure," said Mr. Percy, "the very first opportunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must make opportunities&mdash;not wait for them," said the
      commissioner, smiling. "Let me entreat that you will pay your respects to
      his lordship as soon as he comes into the country. It really is but civil&mdash;and
      take me in your hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all my heart," said Mr. Percy; "but mine shall only be a visit of
      civility."
    </p>
    <p>
      Well satisfied with having obtained this promise, Commissioner Falconer
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides his general desire to be acquainted with the great, the
      commissioner had particular reasons for wishing to be introduced at this
      time to Lord Oldborough, and he had a peculiar cause for being curious
      about M. de Tourville.&mdash;Mr. Falconer was in possession of the packet
      which that diplomatist had lost. It had been found by one of the
      commissioner's sons, Mr. John Falconer; or rather by Mr. John Falconer's
      dog, Neptune, who brought it to his master when he was bathing in the sea
      the day after the shipwreck. It had been thrown by the tide among some
      sea-weed, where it was entangled, and where it lay hid till it was
      discovered by the dog. Mr. John Falconer had carried it home, and boasting
      of his dog's sagacity, had produced it rather as a proof of the capital
      manner in which he had taught Neptune to fetch and carry, than from any
      idea or care for the value of the packet; John Falconer being one of those
      men who care for very little in this world,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Whilst they have their dog and their gun."
</pre>
    <p>
      Not so the commissioner, who immediately began to examine the papers with
      serious curiosity, to discover whether they could by any means be
      productive of advantage to him or his family. The sea-water had injured
      only the outer pages; but though the inner were not in the least damaged,
      it was difficult to make out their contents, for they were written in
      cipher. Commissioner Falconer, however, was skilled in the art of
      deciphering, and possessed all the ingenuity and patience necessary for
      the business. The title, superscription, and signature of the paper were
      obliterated, so that he could not guess from whom they came, or to whom
      they were addressed; he perceived that they were political; but of what
      degree of importance they might be he could not decide, till he heard of
      M. de Tourville the diplomatist, and of his distress at the loss of this
      packet. The commissioner then resolved to devote the evening, ensuing day,
      and night, if requisite, to the business, that he might have it in
      readiness to carry with him when he went to pay his respects to Lord
      Oldborough. Foreseeing that something might be made of this intercepted
      despatch, and fearing that if he mentioned it to Mr. Percy, that gentleman
      might object to opening the papers, Mr. Falconer left Percy-hall without
      giving the most remote hint of the treasure which he possessed, or of the
      use that he intended to make of his discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the ensuing week Mr. Percy went to pay his visit of civility, and
      Mr. Falconer his visit of policy, to Lord Oldborough. His lordship was so
      much altered, that it was with difficulty Mr. Percy recollected in him any
      traces of the same person. The Lord Oldborough he had formerly known was
      gay, gallant, and rather dissipated; of a frank, joyous air and manner.
      The Lord Oldborough whom he now saw was a serious, reserved-looking
      personage, with a face in which the lines of thought and care were deeply
      marked; large eyebrows, vigilant eyes, with an expression of ability and
      decision in his whole countenance, but not of tranquillity or of
      happiness. His manner was well-bred, but rather cold and formal: his
      conversation circumspect, calculated to draw forth the opinions, and to
      benefit by the information of others, rather than to assert or display his
      own. He seemed to converse, to think, to live, not with any enjoyment of
      the present, but with a view to some future object, about which he was
      constantly anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy and Mr. Falconer both observed Lord Oldborough attentively
      during this visit: Mr. Percy studied him with philosophical curiosity, to
      discover what changes had been made in his lordship's character by the
      operation of ambition, and to determine how far that passion had
      contributed to his happiness; Mr. Falconer studied him with the interested
      eye of a man of the world, eager to discern what advantage could be made
      by ministering to that ambition, and to decide whether there was about his
      lordship the making of a good patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, he thought, the right twist, if he had but skill to follow, and
      humour it in the working; but this was a task of much nicety. Lord
      Oldborough appeared to be aware of the commissioner's views, and was not
      disposed to burden himself with new <i>friends</i>. It seemed easy to go
      to a certain point with his lordship, but difficult to get farther; easy
      to obtain his attention, but impossible to gain his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner, however, had many resources ready; many small means of
      fastening himself both on his lordship's private and public interests. He
      determined to begin first with the despatch which he had been deciphering.
      With this view he led Mr. Percy to speak of the shipwreck, and of M. de
      Tourville. Lord Oldborough's attention was immediately awakened; and when
      Mr. Falconer perceived that the regret for not having seen M. de
      Tourville, and the curiosity to know the nature of his secret negotiations
      had been sufficiently excited, the commissioner quitted the subject, as he
      could go no farther whilst restrained by Mr. Percy's presence. He took the
      first opportunity of leaving the room with his lordship's nephew, Col.
      Hauton, to look at some horses, which were to run at the ensuing races.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone with Mr. Percy, Lord Oldborough looked less reserved, for he
      plainly saw, indeed Mr. Percy plainly showed, that he had nothing to ask
      from the great man, but that he came only to see his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many years since we met, Mr. Percy," said his lordship, sitting down and
      placing his chair for the first time without considering whether his face
      or his back were to the light.&mdash;"A great many years since we met, Mr.
      Percy; and yet I should not think so from your appearance; you do not look
      as if&mdash;shall I say it?&mdash;five-and-twenty years had passed since
      that time. But you have been leading an easy life in the country&mdash;the
      happiest life: I envy you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy, thinking that these were words of course, the mere polite <i>cant</i>
      of a courtier to a country gentleman, smiled, and replied, that few who
      were acquainted with their different situations in the world would imagine
      that Mr. Percy could be an object of envy to Lord Oldborough, a statesman
      at the summit of favour and fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the summit," said Lord Oldborough, sighing; "and if I were even at
      the summit, it is, you know, a dangerous situation. Fortune's wheel never
      stands still&mdash;the highest point is therefore the most perilous." His
      lordship sighed again as deeply as before; then spoke, or rather led to
      the subject of general politics, of which Mr. Percy gave his opinions with
      freedom and openness, yet without ever forgetting the respect due to Lord
      Oldborough's situation. His lordship seemed sensible of this attention,
      sometimes nodded, and sometimes smiled, as Mr. Percy spoke of public men
      or measures; but when he expressed any sentiment of patriotism, or of
      public virtue, Lord Oldborough took to his snuff-box, shook and levelled
      the snuff; and if he listened, listened as to words superfluous and
      irrelevant. When Mr. Percy uttered any principle favourable to the liberty
      of the press, or of the people, his lordship would take several pinches of
      snuff rapidly, to hide the expression of his countenance; if the topics
      were continued, his averted eyes and compressed lips showed
      disapprobation, and the difficulty he felt in refraining from reply. From
      reply, however, he did absolutely refrain; and after a pause of a few
      moments, with a smile, in a softer and lower voice than his usual tone, he
      asked Mr. Percy some questions about his family, and turned the
      conversation again to domestic affairs;&mdash;expressed surprise, that a
      man of Mr. Percy's talents should live in such absolute retirement; and
      seeming to forget what he had said himself but half an hour before, of the
      pains and dangers of ambition, and all that Mr. Percy had said of his love
      of domestic life, appeared to take it for granted that Mr. Percy would be
      glad to shine in public, if opportunity were not wanting. Upon this
      supposition, his lordship dexterously pointed out ways by which he might
      distinguish himself; threw out assurances of his own good wishes,
      compliments to his talents; and, in short, sounded his heart, still
      expecting to find corruption or ambition at the bottom. But none was to be
      found. Lord Oldborough was convinced of it&mdash;and surprised. Perhaps
      his esteem for Mr. Percy's understanding fell some degrees&mdash;he
      considered him as an eccentric person, acting from unaccountable motives;
      but still he respected him as that rarest of all things in a politician's
      eye&mdash;a really honest independent man. He believed also that Mr. Percy
      had some regard for him; and whatever portion it might be, it was valuable
      and extraordinary&mdash;for it was disinterested: besides, they could
      never cross in their objects&mdash;and as Mr. Percy lived out of the
      world, and had no connexion with any party, he was a perfectly safe man.
      All these thoughts acted so powerfully upon Lord Oldborough, that he threw
      aside his reserve, in a manner which would have astonished and delighted
      Mr. Falconer. Mr. Percy was astonished, but not delighted&mdash;he saw a
      noble mind corroded and debased by ambition&mdash;virtuous principle,
      generous feeling, stifled&mdash;a powerful, capacious understanding
      distorted&mdash;a soul, once expatiating and full of high thoughts, now
      confined to a span&mdash;bent down to low concerns&mdash;imprisoned in the
      precincts of a court.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You pity me," said Lord Oldborough, who seemed to understand Mr. Percy's
      thoughts; "you pity me&mdash;I pity myself. But such is ambition, and I
      cannot live without it&mdash;once and always its slave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A person of such a strong mind as Lord Oldborough could emancipate
      himself from any slavery&mdash;even that of habit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if he wished to break through it&mdash;but he does not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can he have utterly&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lost his taste for freedom? you would say. Yes&mdash;utterly. I see you
      pity me," said his lordship with a bitter smile; "and," added he, rising
      proudly, "I am unused to be pitied, and I am awkward, I fear, under the
      obligation." Resuming his friendly aspect, however, in a moment or two, he
      followed Mr. Percy, who had turned to examine a fine picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; a Corregio. You are not aware, my dear sir," continued he, "that
      between the youth you knew at Paris, and the man who has now the honour to
      speak to you, there is nothing in common&mdash;absolutely nothing&mdash;except
      regard for Mr. Percy. You had always great knowledge of character, I
      remember; but with respect to my own, you will recollect that I have the
      advantage of possessing <i>la carte du pays</i>. You are grown quite a
      philosopher, I find; and so am I, in my own way. In short, to put the
      question between us at rest for ever, <i>there is nothing left for me in
      life but ambition</i>. Now let us go to Corregio, or what you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy followed his lordship's lead immediately to Italy, to France, to
      Paris, and talking over old times and youthful days, the conversation grew
      gay and familiar. Lord Oldborough seemed enlivened and pleased, and yet,
      as if it were a reminiscence of a former state of existence, he often
      repeated, "Ah! those were young days&mdash;very young: I was a boy then&mdash;quite
      a boy." At last Mr. Percy touched upon love and women, and, by accident,
      mentioned an Italian lady whom they had known abroad.&mdash;A flash of
      pale anger, almost of frenzy, passed across Lord Oldborough's countenance:
      he turned short, darted full on Mr. Percy a penetrating, imperious,
      interrogative look.&mdash;Answered by the innocence, the steady openness
      of Mr. Percy's countenance, Lord Oldborough grew red instantly, and,
      conscious of his unusual change of colour, stood actually abashed. A
      moment afterward, commanding his agitation, he forced his whole person to
      an air of tranquillity&mdash;took up the red book which lay upon his
      table, walked deliberately to a window, and, looking earnestly through his
      glass, asked if Mr. Percy could recollect who was member for some borough
      in the neighbourhood? The conversation after this languished; and though
      some efforts were made, it never recovered the tone of ease and
      confidence. Both parties felt relieved from an indefinable sort of
      constraint by the return of the other gentlemen. Mr. Falconer begged Mr.
      Percy to go and look at a carriage of a new construction, which the
      colonel had just brought from town; and the colonel accompanying Mr.
      Percy, the stage was thus left clear for the commissioner to open his
      business about M. de Tourville's packet. He did it with so much address,
      and with so little circumlocution, that Lord Oldborough immediately
      comprehended how important the papers might be to him, and how necessary
      it was to secure the decipherer. When Mr. Percy returned, he found the
      commissioner and his lordship in earnest and seemingly confidential
      conversation. Both Mr. Falconer and Mr. Percy were now pressed to stay to
      dine and to sleep at Clermont-park; an invitation which Mr. Percy
      declined, but which the commissioner accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, when the company who had dined at Clermont-park were
      settled to cards and music, Lord Oldborough, after walking up and down the
      room with the commissioner in silence for some minutes, retired with him
      into his study, rang, and gave orders that they should not be interrupted
      on any account till supper. The servant informed his lordship that such
      and such persons, whom he had appointed, were waiting.&mdash;"I cannot
      possibly see them till to-morrow," naming the hour. The servant laid on
      the table before his lordship a huge parcel of letters. Lord Oldborough,
      with an air of repressed impatience, bid the man send his secretary, Mr.
      Drakelow,&mdash;looked over the letters, wrote with a pencil, and with
      great despatch, a few words on the back of each&mdash;met Mr. Drakelow as
      he entered the room&mdash;put the unfolded letters all together into his
      hands&mdash;"The answers on the back&mdash;to be made out in form&mdash;ready
      for signature at six to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lord. May I ask&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask nothing, sir, if you please&mdash;I am busy&mdash;you have your
      directions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Drakelow bowed submissive, and made his exit with great celerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now to our business, my dear sir," said his lordship, seating himself at
      the table with Mr. Falconer, who immediately produced M. de Tourville's
      papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not at this period of our story necessary to state precisely their
      contents; it is sufficient to say, that they opened to Lord Oldborough a
      scene of diplomatic treachery abroad, and of ungrateful duplicity at home.
      From some of the intercepted letters he discovered that certain of his
      colleagues, who appeared to be acting along with him with the utmost
      cordiality, were secretly combined against him; and were carrying on an
      underplot, to deprive him at once of popularity, favour, place, and power.
      The strength, firmness, hardness of mind, which Lord Oldborough exhibited
      at the moment of this discovery, perfectly amazed Mr. Falconer. His
      lordship gave no sign of astonishment, uttered no indignant exclamation,
      nor betrayed any symptoms of alarm; but he listened with motionless
      attention, when Mr. Falconer from time to time interrupted his reading,
      and put himself to great expense of face and lungs to express his
      abhorrence of "such inconceivable treachery." Lord Oldborough maintained
      an absolute silence, and waiting till the commissioner had exhausted
      himself in invective, would point with his pencil to the line in the paper
      where he had left off, and calmly say&mdash;"Have the goodness to go on&mdash;Let
      us proceed, sir, if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner went on till he came to the most important and
      interesting point, and then glancing his eye on his intended patron's
      profile, which was towards him, he suddenly stopped. Lord Oldborough,
      raising his head from the hand on which it leaned, turned his full front
      face upon Mr. Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me hear the whole, if you please, sir.&mdash;To form a judgment upon
      any business, it is necessary to have the whole before us.&mdash;You need
      not fear to shock my feelings, sir. I wish always to see men and things as
      they are." Mr. Falconer still hesitating, and turning over the leaves&mdash;"As
      my friend in this business, Mr. Falconer," continued his lordship, "you
      will comprehend that the essential point is to put me as soon as possible
      in possession of the facts&mdash;then I can decide, and act. If it will
      not fatigue you too much, I wish to go through these papers before I
      sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fatigue! Oh, my lord, I am not in the least&mdash;cannot be fatigued! But
      the fact is, I cannot go on; for the next pages I have not yet deciphered&mdash;the
      cipher changes here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough looked much disappointed and provoked; but, after a few
      minutes' pause, calmly said, "What time will it take, sir, to decipher the
      remainder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner protested he did not know&mdash;could not form an idea&mdash;he
      and his son had spent many hours of intense labour on the first papers
      before he could make out the first cipher&mdash;now this was a new one,
      probably more difficult, and whether he could make it out at all, or in
      what time, he was utterly unable to say. Lord Oldborough replied, "Let us
      understand one another at once, Commissioner Falconer, if you please. My
      maxim, and the maxim of every man in public life is, or ought to be&mdash;Serve
      me, and I will serve you. I have no pretensions to Mr. Falconer's
      friendship on any other grounds, I am sensible; nor on any other terms can
      he have a claim to whatever power of patronage I possess. But I neither
      serve nor will be served by halves: my first object is to make myself
      master, as soon as possible, of the contents of the papers in your hands;
      my next to secure your inviolable secrecy on the whole transaction."
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner was going to make vows of secrecy and protestations of
      zeal, but Lord Oldborough cut all that short with "Of course&mdash;of
      course," pronounced in the driest accent, and went on with, "Now, sir, you
      know my object; will you do me the honour to state yours?&mdash;you will
      excuse my abruptness&mdash;time in some circumstances is every thing&mdash;Do
      me and yourself the justice to say at once what return I can make for the
      service you have done or may do me and government."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My only hesitation in speaking, my lord, was&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have no hesitation in speaking, I beseech you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      I <i>beseech</i>, in tone, was in effect, I <i>command</i> you, sir;&mdash;and
      Mr. Falconer, under the influence of an imperious and superior mind, came
      at once to that point, which he had not intended to come to for a month,
      or to approach till after infinite precaution and circumlocution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My object is to push my son Cunningham in the diplomatic line, my lord&mdash;and
      I wish to make him one of your secretaries."
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner stopped short, astonished to find that the truth, and the
      whole truth, had absolutely passed his lips, and in such plain words; but
      they could not be recalled: he gasped for breath&mdash;and began an
      apologetical sentence about poor Mr. Drakelow, whom he should be sorry to
      injure or displace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind that now&mdash;time enough to think of Drakelow," said Lord
      Oldborough, walking up and down the room&mdash;then stopping short, "I
      must see your son, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will bring him here to-morrow, if your lordship pleases."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soon as possible! But he can come surely without your going for him&mdash;write,
      and beg that we may see him at breakfast&mdash;at nine, if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was written, and despatched immediately. Lord Oldborough,
      whilst the commissioner was writing, noted down the heads of what he had
      learned from M. de Tourville's packet: then locked up those of the papers
      which had been deciphered, put the others into Mr. Falconer's charge, and
      recommended it to him to use all possible despatch in deciphering the
      remainder.&mdash;The commissioner declared he would sit up all night at
      the task; this did not appear to be more than was expected.&mdash;His
      lordship rung, and ordered candles in Mr. Falconer's room, then returned
      to the company in the saloon, without saying another word. None could
      guess by his countenance or deportment that any unusual circumstance had
      happened, or that his mind was in the least perturbed. Mrs. Drakelow
      thought he was wholly absorbed in a rubber of whist, and Miss Drakelow at
      the same time was persuaded that he was listening to her music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punctual to the appointed hour&mdash;for ambition is as punctual to
      appointments as love&mdash;Mr. Cunningham Falconer made his appearance at
      nine, and was presented by his father to Lord Oldborough, who received
      him, not with any show of gracious kindness, but as one who had been
      forced upon him by circumstances, and whom, for valuable considerations,
      he had bargained to take into his service. To try the young diplomatist's
      talents, Lord Oldborough led him first to speak on the subject of the
      Tourville papers, then urged him on to the affairs of Germany, and the
      general interests and policy of the different courts of Europe. Trembling,
      and in agony for his son, the commissioner stood aware of the danger of
      the youth's venturing out of his depth, aware also of the danger of
      showing that he dared not venture, and incapable of deciding between these
      equal fears: but soon he was re-assured by the calmness of his son.
      Cunningham, who had not so much information or capacity, but who had less
      sensibility than his father, often succeeded where his father's timidity
      prognosticated failure. Indeed, on the present occasion, the care which
      the young diplomatist took not to commit himself, the dexterity with which
      he "helped himself by countenance and gesture," and "was judicious by
      signs," proved that he was well skilled in all those arts of <i>seeming
      wise</i>, which have been so well noted for use by "the greatest, wisest,
      meanest of mankind." Young though he was, Cunningham was quite
      sufficiently slow, circumspect, and solemn, to deserve to be ranked among
      those whom Bacon calls <i>Formalists</i>, "who do nothing, or little, very
      solemnly&mdash;who seem always to keep back somewhat; and when they know
      within themselves that they speak of what they do not know, would,
      nevertheless, seem to others to know that of which they may not well
      speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough listened to whatever he said, and marked all that he did
      not say with an air of attentive composure, which, as Mr. Falconer
      thought, augured well for his son; but now and then there was, for
      scarcely a definable portion of time, an expression of humour in his
      lordship's eye, a sarcastic smile, which escaped the commissioner's
      observation, and which, even if he had observed, he could not, with his
      limited knowledge of Lord Oldborough's character, have rightly
      interpreted. If his lordship had expressed his thoughts, perhaps, they
      might have been, though in words less quaint, nearly the same as those of
      the philosophic statesman, who says, "It is a ridiculous thing, and fit
      for a satire to persons of judgment, to see what shifts these <i>formalists</i>
      have, and what prospectives to make superficies to seem body that hath
      depth and bulk."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lord Oldborough philosophizing, and Lord Oldborough acting, were two
      different people. His perception of the ridicule of the young secretary's
      solemnity, and of the insufficiency of his information and capacity, made
      no alteration in the minister's determination. The question was not
      whether the individual was fit for this place, or that employment, but
      whether it was expedient he should have it for the security of political
      power. Waiving all delicacy, Lord Oldborough now, as in most other cases,
      made it his chief object to be understood and obeyed; therefore he applied
      directly to the universal motive, and spoke the universal language of
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Falconer," said he, "if you put me in possession of the remainder of
      M. de Tourville's papers this night, I will to-morrow morning put this
      young gentleman into the hands of my present secretary, Mr. Drakelow, who
      will prepare him for the situation you desire. Mr. Drakelow himself will,
      probably, soon leave me, to be employed more advantageously for his
      majesty's service, in some other manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      The decipherers, father and son, shut themselves up directly, and set to
      work with all imaginable zeal. The whole packet was nearly expounded
      before night, and the next morning Lord Oldborough performed his part of
      the agreement. He sent for Mr. Drakelow, and said, "Mr. Drakelow, I beg
      that, upon your return to town, you will be so good as to take this young
      gentleman, Mr. Cunningham Falconer, to your office. Endeavour to prepare
      him to supply your place with me whenever it may be proper for his
      majesty's service, and for your interest, to send you to Constantinople,
      or elsewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Drakelow, though infinitely surprised and displeased, bowed all
      submission. Nothing else he knew was to be done with Lord Oldborough. His
      lordship, as soon as his secretary had left the room, turned to
      Cunningham, and said, "You will not mention anything concerning M. de
      Tourville's intercepted papers to Mr. Drakelow, or to any other person.
      Affairs call me to town immediately: to-morrow morning at six, I set off.
      You will, if you please, sir, be ready to accompany me. I will not detain
      you longer from any preparations you may have to make for your journey."
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had the father and son quitted Lord Oldborough's presence than
      Mr. Falconer exclaimed with exultation, "I long to see our good cousin
      Percy, that I may tell him how I have provided already for one of my
      sons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But remember, sir," said Cunningham, "that Mr. Percy is to know nothing
      of the Tourville packet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure not," said Mr. Falconer; "he is to know nothing of the means,
      he is to see only the end&mdash;the successful end. Ha! cousin Percy, I
      think we know rather better than you do how to make something of every
      thing&mdash;even of a shipwreck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To prevent his having any suspicions," continued Cunningham, "it will be
      best to give Mr. Percy some probable reason for Lord Oldborough's <i>taking
      to us</i> so suddenly. It will be well to hint that you have opportunities
      of obliging about the borough, or about the address at the county-meeting,
      or&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; no particulars; never go to particulars," said old Falconer:
      "stick to generals, and you are safe. Say, in general, that I had an
      opportunity of obliging government. Percy is not curious, especially about
      <i>jobbing</i>. He will ask no questions; or, if he should, I can easily
      put him upon a wrong scent. Now, Cunningham, listen to me: I have done my
      best, and have pushed you into a fine situation: but remember, you cannot
      get on in the diplomatic line without a certain degree of diplomatic
      information. I have pointed this out to you often; you have neglected to
      make yourself master of these things, and, for want of them in office, you
      will come, I fear, some day or other to shame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not be afraid of that&mdash;no danger of my coming to shame any more
      than a thousand other people in office, who never trouble themselves about
      diplomatic information, and all that. There is always some clerk who knows
      the forms, and with those, and looking for what one wants upon the spur of
      the occasion in books and pamphlets, and so forth, one may go on very well&mdash;if
      one does but know how to keep one's own counsel. You see I got through
      with Lord Oldborough to-day&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay&mdash;but I assure you I trembled for you, and I could have squeezed
      myself into an auger-hole once, when you blundered about that treaty of
      which I knew that you knew nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! sir, I assure you I had turned over the leaves. I was correct enough
      as to the dates; and, suppose I blundered, as my brother Buckhurst says,
      half the world never know what they are saying, and the other half never
      find it out.&mdash;Why, sir, you were telling me the other night such a
      blunder of Prince Potemkin's&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true," interrupted the commissioner; "but you are not Prince
      Potemkin, nor yet a prime minister; if you were, no matter how little you
      knew&mdash;you might get other people to supply your deficiencies. But
      now, in your place, and in the course of making your way upwards, you will
      be called upon to supply <i>others</i> with the information they may want.
      And you know I shall not be always at your elbow; therefore I really am
      afraid&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear sir, fear nothing," said Cunningham: "I shall do as well as others
      do&mdash;the greatest difficulty is over. I have taken the first step, and
      it has cost nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, get on, my boy&mdash;honestly, if you can&mdash;but get on."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      With the true genius of a political castle-builder, Mr. Falconer began to
      add story after story to the edifice, of which he had thus promptly and
      successfully laid the foundation. Having by a lucky hit provided for one
      of his sons, that is to say, put him in a fair way of being provided for,
      the industrious father began to form plans for the advancement of his two
      other sons, Buckhurst and John: Buckhurst was destined by his father for
      the church; John for the army. The commissioner, notwithstanding he had
      been closeted for some hours with Lord Oldborough, and notwithstanding his
      son Cunningham was to be one of his lordship's secretaries, was well aware
      that little or no progress had been made in Lord Oldborough's real favour
      or confidence. Mr. Falconer knew that he had been literally <i>paid by the
      job</i>, that he was considered and treated accordingly; yet, upon the
      whole, he was well pleased that it should be so, for he foresaw the
      possibility of his doing for his lordship many more jobs, public and
      private. He lost no time in preparing for the continuity of his secret
      services, and in creating a political necessity for his being employed in
      future, in a manner that might ensure the advancement of the rest of his
      family. In the first place, he knew that Lord Oldborough was desirous, for
      the enlargement of the grounds at Clermont-park, to purchase certain
      adjoining lands, which, from some ancient pique, the owner was unwilling
      to sell. The proprietor was a tenant of Mr. Falconer's: he undertook to
      negotiate the business, and to use his influence to bring his tenant to
      reason. This offer, made through Cunningham, was accepted by Lord
      Oldborough, and the negotiation led to fresh communications.&mdash;There
      was soon to be a county meeting, and an address was to be procured in
      favour of certain measures of government, which it was expected would be
      violently opposed. In the commissioner's letters to his son, the private
      secretary, he could say and suggest whatever he pleased; he pointed out
      the gentlemen of the county who ought to be conciliated, and he offered
      his services to represent things properly to some with whom he was
      intimate. The sheriff and the under-sheriff also should know, without
      being informed directly from ministry, what course in conducting the
      meeting would be agreeable in a certain quarter&mdash;who so proper to say
      and do all that might be expedient as Mr. Falconer, who was on the spot,
      and well acquainted with the county?&mdash;The commissioner was informed
      by the private secretary, that his services would be acceptable. There
      happened also, at this time, to be some disputes and grievances in that
      part of the country about tax-gatherers. Mr. Falconer hinted, that he
      could soften and accommodate matters, if he were empowered to do so&mdash;and
      he was so empowered. Besides all this, there was a borough in that county,
      in which the interest of government had been declining; attempts were made
      to <i>open the borough</i>&mdash;Mr. Falconer could be of use in <i>keeping
      it close</i>&mdash;and he was commissioned to do every thing in his power
      in the business. In a short time Mr. Falconer was acting on all these
      points as an agent and partizan of Lord Oldborough's. But there was one
      thing which made him uneasy; he was acting here, as in many former
      instances, merely upon vague hopes of future reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst his mind was full of these thoughts, a new prospect of advantage
      opened to him in another direction. Colonel Hauton, Lord Oldborough's
      nephew, stayed, during his uncle's absence, at Clermont-park, to be in
      readiness for the races, which, this year, were expected to be uncommonly
      fine. Buckhurst Falconer had been at school and at the university with the
      colonel, and had frequently helped him in his Latin exercises. The colonel
      having been always deficient in scholarship, he had early contracted an
      aversion to literature, which at last amounted to an antipathy even to the
      very sight of books, in consequence, perhaps, of his uncle's ardent and
      precipitate desire to make him apply to them whilst his head was full of
      tops and balls, kites and ponies. Be this as it may, Commissioner Falconer
      thought his son Buckhurst might benefit by his school friendship, and
      might now renew and improve the connexion. Accordingly, Buckhurst waited
      upon the colonel,&mdash;was immediately recognized, and received with
      promising demonstrations of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult, indeed impossible, to describe Colonel Hauton, so
      as to distinguish him from a thousand other young men of the same class,
      except, perhaps, that he might be characterized by having more exclusive
      and inveterate selfishness. Yet this was so far from appearing or being
      suspected on a first acquaintance, that he was generally thought a
      sociable, good-natured fellow. It was his absolute dependence upon others
      for daily amusement and ideas, or, rather, for knowing what to do with
      himself, that gave him this semblance of being sociable; the total want of
      proper pride and dignity in his whole deportment, a certain <i>slang</i>
      and familiarity of tone, gave superficial observers the notion that he was
      good-natured. It was Colonel Hauton's great ambition to look like his own
      coachman; he succeeded only so far as to look like his groom: but though
      he kept company with jockeys and coachmen, grooms and stable-boys, yet not
      the stiffest, haughtiest, flat-backed Don of Spain, in Spain's proudest
      days, could be more completely aristocratic in his principles, or more
      despotic in his habits. This could not break out to his equals, and his
      equals cared little how he treated his inferiors. His present pleasure, or
      rather his present business, for no man made more a business of pleasure
      than Colonel Hauton, was <i>the turf</i>. Buckhurst Falconer could not
      here assist him as much as in making Latin verses&mdash;but he could
      admire and sympathize; and the colonel, proud of being now the superior,
      proud of his <i>knowing style</i> and his <i>capital</i> stud, enjoyed
      Buckhurst's company particularly, pressed him to stay at Clermont-park,
      and to accompany him to the races. There was to be a <i>famous</i> match
      between Colonel Hauton's High-Blood and Squire Burton's Wildfire; and the
      preparations of the horses and of their riders occupied the intervening
      days. With all imaginable care, anxiety, and solemnity, these important
      preparations were conducted. At stated hours, Colonel Hauton, and with him
      Buckhurst, went to see High-Blood rubbed down, and fed, and watered, and
      exercised, and minuted, and rubbed down, and littered. Next to the horse,
      the rider, Jack Giles, was to be attended to with the greatest solicitude;
      he was to be weighed&mdash;and starved&mdash;and watched&mdash;and drammed&mdash;and
      <i>sweated</i>&mdash;and weighed again&mdash;and so on in daily
      succession; and harder still, through this whole course he was to be kept
      in humour: "None that ever sarved man or beast," as the stable-boy
      declared, "ever worked harder for their bread than his master and master's
      companion did this week for their pleasure." At last the great, the
      important day arrived, and Jack Giles was weighed for the last time in
      public, and so was Tom Hand, Squire Burton's rider&mdash;and High-Blood
      and Wildfire were brought out; and the spectators assembled in the stand,
      and about the scales, were all impatience, especially those who had betted
      on either of the horses. And, Now, Hauton!&mdash;Now, Burton!&mdash;Now,
      High-Blood!&mdash;Now, Wildfire!&mdash;Now, Jack Giles!&mdash;and Now, Tom
      Hand! resounded on all sides. The gentlemen on the race-ground were all on
      tiptoe in their stirrups. The ladies in the stand stretched their necks of
      snow, and nobody looked at them.&mdash;Two men were run over, and nobody
      took them up.&mdash;Two ladies fainted, and two gentlemen betted across
      them. This was no time for nice observances&mdash;Jack Giles's spirit
      began to flag&mdash;and Tom Hand's judgment <i>to tell</i>&mdash;High-Blood,
      on the full stretch, was within view of the winning-post, when Wildfire,
      quite in wind, was put to his speed by the judicious Tom Hand&mdash;he
      sprang forward, came up with High-Blood&mdash;passed him&mdash;Jack Giles
      strove in vain to regain his ground&mdash;High-Blood was blown, beyond the
      power of whip or spur&mdash;Wildfire reached the post, and Squire Burton
      won the match hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friends congratulated him and themselves loudly, and extolled Tom Hand
      and Wildfire to the skies. In the moment of disappointment, Colonel
      Hauton, out of humour, said something that implied a suspicion of
      unfairness on the part of Burton or Tom Hand, which the honest squire
      could not brook either for self or rider. He swore that his Tom Hand was
      as honest a fellow as any in England, and he would back him for such. The
      colonel, depending on his own and his uncle's importance, on his party and
      his flatterers, treated the squire with some of the haughtiness of rank,
      which the squire retorted with some rustic English humour. The colonel,
      who had not wit at will to put down his antagonist, became still more
      provoked to see that such a low-born fellow as the squire should and could
      laugh and make others laugh. For the lack of wit the colonel had recourse
      to insolence, and went on from one impertinence to another, till the
      squire, enraged, declared that he would not be browbeat by any lord's
      nephew or jackanapes colonel that ever wore a head; and as he spoke,
      tremendous in his ire, Squire Burton brandished high the British
      horsewhip. At this critical moment, as it has been asserted by some of the
      bystanders, the colonel <i>quailed</i> and backed a few paces; but others
      pretend that Buckhurst Falconer pushed before him. It is certain that
      Buckhurst stopped the blow&mdash;wrested the horsewhip from the squire&mdash;was
      challenged by him on the spot&mdash;accepted the challenge&mdash;fought
      the squire&mdash;<i>winged</i> him&mdash;appeared on the race ground
      afterwards, and was admired by the ladies in public, and by his father in
      private, who looked upon the duel and horsewhipping, from which he thus
      saved his patron's nephew, as the most fortunate circumstance that could
      have happened to his son upon his entrance into life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such an advantage as this gives us such a claim upon the colonel&mdash;and,
      indeed, upon the whole family. Lord Oldborough, having no children of his
      own, looks to the nephew as his heir; and though he may be vexed now and
      then by the colonel's extravagance, and angry that he could not give this
      nephew more of a political turn, yet such as he is, depend upon it he can
      do what he pleases with Lord Oldborough. Whoever has the nephew's ear, has
      the uncle's heart; or I should say, whoever has the nephew's heart, has
      the uncle's ear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mayn't we as well put hearts out of the question on all sides, sir?" said
      Buckhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all my heart," said his father, laughing, "provided we don't put a
      good living out of the question on our side."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst looked averse, and said he did not know there was any such thing
      in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said his father: "was it then from the pure and abstract love of
      being horsewhipped, or shot at, that you took this quarrel off his hands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith! I did it from spirit, pure spirit," said Buckhurst: "I could not
      stand by, and see one who had been my schoolfellow horsewhipped&mdash;if
      he did not stand by himself, <i>yet</i> I could not but stand by <i>him</i>,
      for you know I was there as one of his party&mdash;and as I backed his
      bets on High-Blood, I could do no less than back his cause altogether.&mdash;Oh!
      I could not stand by and see <i>a chum</i> of my own horsewhipped."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that was all very spirited and generous; but now, as you are
      something too old for mere schoolboy notions," said the commissioner, "let
      us look a little farther, and see what we can make of it. It's only a
      silly boyish thing as you consider it; but I hope we can turn it to good
      account."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never thought of turning it to account, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think of it now," said the father, a little provoked by the careless
      disinterestedness of the son. "In plain English, here is a colonel in his
      majesty's service saved from a horsewhipping&mdash;a whole noble family
      saved from disgrace: these are things not to be forgotten; that is, not to
      be forgotten, if you force people to remember them: otherwise&mdash;my
      word for it&mdash;I know the great&mdash;the whole would be forgotten in a
      week. Therefore, leave me to follow the thing up properly with the uncle,
      and do you never let it sleep with the nephew: sometimes a bold stroke,
      sometimes a delicate touch, just as the occasion serves, or as may suit
      the company present&mdash;all that I trust to your own address and
      judgment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust nothing, sir, to my address or judgment; for in these things I have
      neither. I always act just from impulse and feeling, right or wrong&mdash;I
      have no talents for <i>finesse</i>&mdash;leave them all to Cunningham&mdash;that's
      his trade, and he likes it, luckily: and you should be content with having
      one such genius in your family&mdash;no family could bear two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, pray be serious, Buckhurst. If you have not or will not use
      any common sense and address to advance yourself, leave that to me. You
      see how I have pushed up Cunningham already, and all I ask of you is to be
      quiet, and let me push you up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! dear sir, I am very much obliged to you: if that is all, I will be
      quite quiet&mdash;so that I am not to do any thing shabby or dirty for it.
      I should be vastly glad to get a good place, and be provided for
      handsomely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt; and let me tell you that many I could name have, with inferior
      claims, and without any natural connexion or relationship, from the mere
      favour of proper friends, obtained church benefices of much greater value
      than the living we have in our eye: you know&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know, indeed," said Buckhurst; "I protest I have no living in my
      eye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! not know that the living of Chipping-Friars is in the gift of
      Colonel Hauton&mdash;and the present incumbent has had one paralytic
      stroke already. There's a prospect for you, Buckhurst!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be frank with you, sir, I have no taste for the church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No taste for nine hundred a year, Buckhurst? No desire for fortune, Mr.
      Philosopher?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, a very strong taste for that, sir&mdash;not a bit of a
      philosopher&mdash;as much in love with fortune as any man, young or old:
      is there no way to fortune but through the church?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None for you so sure and so easy, all circumstances considered," said his
      father. "I have planned and settled it, and you have nothing to do but to
      get yourself ordained as soon as possible. I shall write to my friend the
      bishop for that purpose this very night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me beg; father, that you will not be so precipitate. Upon my word,
      sir, I cannot go into orders. I am not&mdash;in short, I am not fit for
      the church."
    </p>
    <p>
      The father stared with an expression between anger and astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have not you gone through the university?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir:&mdash;but&mdash;but I am scarcely sober, and <i>staid</i>, and
      moral enough for the church. Such a wild fellow as I am, I really could
      not in conscience&mdash;I would not upon any account, for any living upon
      earth, or any emolument, go into the church, unless I thought I should do
      credit to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why should not you do credit to the church? I don't see that you are
      wilder than your neighbours, and need not be more scrupulous. There is G&mdash;&mdash;,
      who at your age was wild enough, but he took up in time, and is now a
      plump dean. Then there is the bishop that is just made: I remember him
      such a youth as you are. Come, come, these are idle scruples. Let me hear
      no more, my dear Buckhurst, of your conscience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear sir, I never pleaded my conscience on any occasion before&mdash;you
      know that I am no puritan&mdash;but really on this point I have some
      conscience, and I beg you not to press me farther. You have other sons;
      and if you cannot spare Cunningham, that treasure of diplomacy!&mdash;there's
      John; surely you might contrive to spare him for the church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spare him I would, and welcome. But you know I could never get John into
      orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not, sir? John, I'll swear, would have no objection to the church,
      provided you could get him a good fat living."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I am not talking of <i>his</i> objections. To be sure he would make
      no objection to a good fat living, nor would any body in his senses,
      except yourself. But I ask you how I could possibly get your brother John
      into the church? John's a dunce,&mdash;and you know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody better, sir: but are there no dunces in the church?&mdash;And as
      you are so good as to think that I'm no wilder than my neighbours, you
      surely will not say that my brother is more a dunce than his neighbours.
      Put him into the hands of a clever grinder or crammer, and they would soon
      cram the necessary portion of Latin and Greek into him, and they would get
      him through the university for us readily enough; and a degree once
      obtained, he might snap his fingers at Latin and Greek all the rest of his
      life. Once in orders, and he might sit down upon his fat living, or lie
      down content, all his days, only taking care to have some poor devil of a
      curate up and about, doing duty for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I find you have no great scruples for your brother, whatever you may
      have for yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I am not the keeper of my brother's conscience&mdash;Indeed, if I
      were, you might congratulate me in the words of Sir B. R. upon the
      possession of a sinecure place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a pity, Buckhurst, that you cannot use your wit for yourself as
      well as for other people. Ah! Buckhurst! Buckhurst! you will, I fear, do
      worse in the world than any of your brothers; for wits are always <i>unlucky</i>:
      sharp-sighted enough to every thing else, but blind, stone blind to their
      own interest. Wit is folly, when one is talking of serious business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear father, be <i>agreeable</i>, and I will not be witty.&mdash;In
      fact, in downright earnest, the sum total of the business is, that I have
      a great desire to go into the army, and I entreat you to procure me a
      commission."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the sum total of the business is, that I will not; for I cannot
      afford to purchase you a commission, and to maintain you in the army&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But by using interest, perhaps, sir," said Buckhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My interest must be all for your brother John; for I tell you I can do
      nothing else for him but put him into the army.&mdash;He's a dunce.&mdash;I
      must get him a commission, and then I have done with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I were a dunce," said Buckhurst, sighing; "for then I might go
      into the army&mdash;instead of being forced into the church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no force upon your inclinations, Buckhurst," said his father in a
      soft tone; "I only show you that it is impossible I should maintain you in
      the army, and, therefore, beg you to put the army out of your head. And I
      don't well see what else you could do. You have not application enough for
      the bar, nor have I any friends among the attorneys except Sharpe, who,
      between you and me, might take your dinners, and leave you without a brief
      afterwards. You have talents, I grant," continued the commissioner, "and
      if you had but application, and if your uncle the judge had not died last
      year&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir, he is dead, and we can't help it," interrupted Buckhurst. "And
      as for me, I never had, and never shall have, any application: so pray put
      the bar out of your mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very cavalier, indeed!&mdash;but I will make you serious at once,
      Buckhurst. You have nothing to expect from my death&mdash;I have not a
      farthing to leave you&mdash;my place, you know, is only for life&mdash;your
      mother's fortune is all in annuity, and two girls to be provided for&mdash;and
      to live as we must live&mdash;up to and beyond my income&mdash;shall have
      nothing to leave. Though you are my eldest son, you see it is in vain to
      look to my death&mdash;so into the church you must go, or be a beggar&mdash;and
      get a living or starve. Now I have done," concluded the commissioner,
      quitting his son; "and I leave you to think of what has been said."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst thought and thought; but still his interest and his conscience
      were at variance, and he could not bring himself either to be virtuous or
      vicious enough to comply with his father's wishes. He could not decide to
      go into the church merely from interested motives&mdash;from that his
      conscience revolted; he could not determine to make himself fit to do
      credit to the sacred profession&mdash;against this his habits and his love
      of pleasure revolted. He went to his brother John, to try what could be
      done with him. Latin and Greek were insuperable objections with John;
      besides, though he had a dull imagination in general, John's fancy had
      been smitten with one bright idea of an epaulette, from which no
      considerations, fraternal, political, moral, or religious, could distract
      his attention.&mdash;His genius, he said, was for the army, and into the
      army he would go.&mdash;So to his genius, Buckhurst, in despair, was
      obliged to leave him.&mdash;The commissioner neglected not to push the
      claim which he had on Colonel Hauton, and he chose his time so well, when
      proper people were by, and when the colonel did not wish to have the
      squire, and the horse-whip, and the duel, brought before the public, that
      he obtained, if not a full acknowledgment of obligation, a promise of
      doing any thing and every thing in his power for his friend Buckhurst. Any
      thing and every thing were indefinite, unsatisfactory terms; and the
      commissioner, bold in dealing with the timid temper of the colonel, though
      he had been cautious with the determined character of the uncle, pressed
      his point&mdash;named the living of Chipping-Friars&mdash;showed how well
      he would be satisfied, and how well he could represent matters, if the
      promise were given; and at the same time made it understood how loudly he
      could complain, and how disgraceful his complaints might prove to the
      Oldborough family, if his son were treated with ingratitude. The colonel
      particularly dreaded that he should be suspected of want of spirit, and
      that his uncle should have the transaction laid before him in this
      improper point of view. He pondered for a few moments, and the promise for
      the living of Chipping-Friars was given. The commissioner, secure of this,
      next returned to the point with his son, and absolutely insisted upon his&mdash;going
      into orders. Buckhurst, who had tried wit and raillery in vain, now tried
      persuasion and earnest entreaties; but these were equally fruitless: his
      father, though an easy, good-natured man, except where his favourite plans
      were crossed, was peremptory, and, without using harsh words, he employed
      the harshest measures to force his son's compliance. Buckhurst had
      contracted some debts at the university, none of any great consequence,
      but such as he could not pay immediately.&mdash;The bets he had laid and
      lost upon High-Blood were also to be provided for; debts of honour claimed
      precedency, and must be directly discharged. His father positively refused
      to assist him, except upon condition of his compliance with his wishes;
      and so far from affording him any means of settling with his creditors, it
      has been proved, from the commissioner's <i>private</i> answers to some of
      their applications, that he not only refused to pay a farthing for his
      son, but encouraged the creditors to threaten him in the strongest manner
      with the terrors of law and arrest. Thus pressed and embarrassed, this
      young man, who had many honourable and religious sentiments and genuine
      feelings, but no power of adhering to principle or reason, was miserable
      beyond expression one hour&mdash;and the next he became totally forgetful
      that there was any thing to be thought of but the amusement of the moment.
      Incapable of coming to any serious decision, he walked up and down his
      room talking, partly to himself, and partly, for want of a better
      companion, to his brother John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I must pay Wallis to-morrow, or he'll arrest me; and I must give my
      father an answer about the church to-night&mdash;for he writes to the
      bishop, and will wait no longer. Oh! hang it.' hang it, John! what the
      devil shall I do? My father won't pay a farthing for me, unless I go into
      the church!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, why can't you go into the church!" said John: "since you are
      through the university, the worst is over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I think it so wrong, so base&mdash;for money&mdash;for emolument! I
      cannot do it. I am not fit for the church&mdash;I know I shall disgrace
      it," said Buckhurst, striking his forehead: "I cannot do it&mdash;I can
      not&mdash;it is against my conscience."
    </p>
    <p>
      John stopped, as he was filling his shooting-pouch, and looked at
      Buckhurst (his mouth half open) with an expression of surprise at these
      demonstrations of sensibility. He had some sympathy for the external
      symptoms of pain which he saw in his brother, but no clear conception of
      the internal cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Buckhurst," said he, "if you cannot do it, you can't, you know,
      Buckhurst: but I don't see why you should be a disgrace to the church more
      than another, as my father says. If I were but through the university, I
      had as lieve go into the church as not&mdash;that's all I can say. And if
      my genius were not for the military line, there's nothing I should relish
      better than the living of Chipping-Friars, I'm sure. The only thing that I
      see against it is, that that paralytic incumbent may live many a year:
      but, then, you get your debts paid now by only going into orders, and
      that's a great point. But if it goes against your conscience&mdash;you
      know best&mdash;if you can't, you can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all, I can't go to jail&mdash;I can't let myself be arrested&mdash;I
      can't starve&mdash;I can't be a beggar," said Buckhurst; "and, as you say,
      I should be so easy if these cursed debts were paid&mdash;and if I got
      this living of nine hundred a year, how comfortable I should be! Then I
      could marry, by Jove! and I'd propose directly for Caroline Percy, for I'm
      confoundedly in love with her&mdash;such a sweet tempered, good creature!&mdash;not
      a girl so much admired! Colonel Hauton, and G&mdash;&mdash;, and P&mdash;&mdash;,
      and D&mdash;&mdash;, asked me, 'Who is that pretty girl?'&mdash;She
      certainly is a very pretty girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She certainly is," repeated John. "This devil of a fellow never cleans my
      gun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not regularly handsome, neither," pursued Buckhurst; "but, as Hauton
      says, fascinating and new; and a new face in public is a great matter.
      Such a fashionable-looking figure, too&mdash;though she has not <i>come
      out</i> yet; dances charmingly&mdash;would dance divinely, if she would
      let herself out; and she sings and plays like an angel, fifty times better
      than our two precious sisters, who have been <i>at it</i> from their
      cradles, with all the Signor <i>Squalicis</i> at their elbows. Caroline
      Percy never exhibits in public: the mother does not like it, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I suppose," said John. "Curse this flint!&mdash;flints are growing
      worse and worse every day&mdash;I wonder what in the world are become of
      all the good flints there used to be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very unlike our mother, I am sure," continued Buckhurst. "There are
      Georgiana and Bell at all the parties and concerts as regularly as any of
      the professors, standing up in the midst of the singing men and women,
      favouring the public in as fine a bravura style, and making as ugly faces
      as the best of them. Do you remember the Italian's compliment to Miss * *
      * * *?&mdash;I vish, miss, I had your <i>assurance</i>.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, ha!&mdash;very fair, faith!" said John. "Do you know what I've
      done with my powder horn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I&mdash;put it in the oven, may be, to dry," said Buckhurst. "But as
      I was saying of my dear Caroline&mdash;<i>My</i> Caroline! she is not mine
      yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true! Why, John, you are enough to provoke a saint!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was agreeing with you, I thought," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But nothing is so provoking as always agreeing with one&mdash;and I can
      tell you, Mr. Verytrue, that though Caroline Percy is not mine yet, I have
      nevertheless a little suspicion, that, such even as I am, she might
      readily be brought to love, honour, and obey me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't doubt it, for I never yet knew a woman that was not ready enough
      to be married," quoth John. "But this is not the right ramrod, after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are wrong, John, on the other side," said Buckhurst; "for I can
      assure you, Miss Caroline Percy is not one of your young ladies who would
      marry any body. And even though she might like me, I am not at all sure
      that she would marry me&mdash;for obedience to the best of fathers might
      interfere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's the point," said John; "for thereby hangs the fortune; and it
      would be a <i>deuced</i> thing to have the girl without the fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so <i>deuced</i> a thing to me as you think," said Buckhurst,
      laughing; "for, poor as I am, I can assure you the fortune is not my
      object&mdash;I am not a mercenary dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By-the-bye," cried John, "now you talk of dogs, I wish to Heaven above,
      you had not given away that fine puppy of mine to that foolish old man,
      who never was out a shooting in his days&mdash;the dog's just as much
      thrown away as if you had drowned him. Now, do you know, if I had had <i>the
      making</i> of that puppy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Puppy!" exclaimed Buckhurst: "is it possible you can be thinking of a
      puppy, John, when I am talking to you of what is of so much consequence?&mdash;when
      the whole happiness of my life is at stake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stake!&mdash;Well, but what can I do more!" said John: "have not I been
      standing here this half hour with my gun in my hand this fine day,
      listening to you prosing about I don't know what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the very thing I complain of&mdash;that you do not know what: a
      pretty brother!" said Buckhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      John made no further reply, but left the room sullenly, whistling as he
      went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to his own cogitations, Buckhurst fell into a reverie upon the charms
      of Caroline Percy, and upon the probable pleasure of dancing with her at
      the race-ball; after this, he recurred to the bitter recollection, that he
      must decide about his debts, and the church. A bright idea came into his
      mind, that he might have recourse to Mr. Percy, and, perhaps, prevail upon
      him to persuade his father not to force him to a step which he could not
      reconcile either to his conscience or his inclination.&mdash;No sooner
      thought than done.&mdash;He called for his horse and rode as hard as he
      could to Percy-hall.&mdash;When a boy he had been intimate in the Percy
      family; but he had been long absent at school and at the university; they
      had seen him only during the vacations, and since his late return to the
      country. Though Mr. Percy could not entirely approve of his character, yet
      he thought there were many good points about Buckhurst; the frankness and
      candour with which he now laid his whole mind and all his affairs open to
      him&mdash;debts&mdash;love&mdash;fears&mdash;hopes&mdash;follies&mdash;faults&mdash;without
      reserve or extenuation, interested Mr. Percy in his favour.&mdash;Pitying
      his distress, and admiring the motives from which he acted, Mr. Percy
      said, that though he had no right to interfere in Mr. Falconer's family
      affairs, yet that he could, and would, so far assist Buckhurst, as to lend
      him the money for which he was immediately pressed, that he might not be
      driven by necessity to go into that profession, which ought to be embraced
      only from the highest and purest motives. Buckhurst thanked him with
      transports of gratitude for this generous kindness, which was far beyond
      his expectations, and which, indeed, had never entered into his hopes. Mr.
      Percy seized the moment when the young man's mind was warmed with good
      feelings, to endeavour to bring him to serious thoughts and rational
      determinations about his future life. He represented, that it was
      unreasonable to expect that his father should let him go into the army,
      when he had received an education to prepare himself for a profession, in
      which his literary talents might be of advantage both to himself and his
      family; that Mr. Falconer was not rich enough to forward two of his sons
      in the army; that if Buckhurst, from conscientious motives, declined the
      provision which his father had in view for him in the church, he was bound
      to exert himself to obtain an independent maintenance in another line of
      life; that he had talents which would succeed at the bar, if he had
      application and perseverance sufficient to go through the necessary
      drudgery at the commencement of the study of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Buckhurst groaned.&mdash;But Mr. Percy observed that there was no
      other way of proving that he acted from conscientious motives respecting
      the church; for otherwise it would appear that he preferred the army only
      because he fancied it would afford a life of idleness and pleasure.&mdash;That
      this would also be his only chance of winning the approbation of the
      object of his affections, and of placing himself in a situation in which
      he could marry.&mdash;Buckhurst, who was capable of being strongly
      influenced by good motives, especially from one who had obliged him,
      instantly, and in the most handsome manner, acknowledged the truth and
      justice of Mr. Percy's arguments, and declared that he was ready to begin
      the study of the law directly, if his father would consent to it; and that
      he would submit to any drudgery rather than do what he felt to be base and
      wrong. Mr. Percy, at his earnest request, applied to Mr. Falconer, and
      with all the delicacy that was becoming, claimed the right of relationship
      to speak of Mr. Falconer's family affairs, and told him what he had
      ventured to do about Buckhurst's debts; and what the young man now wished
      for himself.&mdash;The commissioner looked much disappointed and vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The bar!" cried he: "Mr. Percy, you don't know him as well as I do. I
      will answer for it, he will never go through with it&mdash;and then he is
      to change his profession again!&mdash;and all the expense and all the
      trouble is to fall on me!&mdash;and I am to provide for him at last!&mdash;In
      all probability, by the time Buckhurst knows his own mind, the paralytic
      incumbent will be dead, and the living of Chipping-Friars given away.&mdash;And
      where am I to find nine hundred a year, I pray you, at a minute's notice,
      for this conscientious youth, who, by that time, will tell me his scruples
      were all nonsense, and that I should have known better than to listen to
      them? Nine hundred a year does not come in a man's way at every turn of
      his life; and if he gives it up now, it is not my fault&mdash;let him look
      to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy replied, "that Buckhurst had declared himself ready to abide by
      the consequences, and that he promised he would never complain of the lot
      he had chosen for himself, much less reproach his father for his
      compliance, and that he was resolute to maintain himself at the bar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes: very fine.&mdash;And how long will it be before he makes nine
      hundred a year at the bar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy, who knew that none but worldly considerations made any
      impression upon this father, suggested that he would have to maintain his
      son during the life of the paralytic incumbent, and the expense of
      Buckhurst's being at the bar would not probably be greater; and though it
      might be several years before he could make nine hundred, or, perhaps, one
      hundred a year at the bar, yet that if he succeeded, which, with
      Buckhurst's talents, nothing but the want of perseverance could prevent,
      he might make nine thousand a year by the profession of the law&mdash;more
      than in the scope of human probability, and with all the patronage his
      father's address could procure, he could hope to obtain in the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let him try&mdash;let him try," repeated the commissioner, who,
      vexed as he was, did not choose to run the risk of disobliging Mr. Percy,
      losing a good match for him, or undergoing the scandal of its being known
      that he forced his son into the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      For obtaining this consent, however reluctantly granted by the
      commissioner, Buckhurst warmly thanked Mr. Percy, who made one condition
      with him, that he would go up to town immediately to commence his studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Buckhurst faithfully promised to do, and only implored permission to
      declare his attachment to Caroline.&mdash;Caroline was at this time not
      quite eighteen, too young, her father said, to think of forming any
      serious engagement, even were it with a person suited to her in fortune
      and in every other respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst declared that he had no idea of endeavouring even to obtain from
      Miss Caroline Percy any promise or engagement.&mdash;He had been treated,
      he said, too generously by her father, to attempt to take any step without
      his entire approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew he was not, and could not for many years, be in circumstances that
      would enable him to support a daughter of Mr. Percy's in the station to
      which she was, by her birth and fortune, entitled.&mdash;All he asked, he
      repeated, was to be permitted to declare to her his passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy thought it was more prudent to let it be declared openly than to
      have it secretly suspected; therefore he consented to this request,
      trusting much to Buckhurst's honour and to Caroline's prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this first declaration of love Caroline listened with a degree of
      composure which astonished and mortified her lover. He had flattered
      himself that, at least, her vanity or pride would have been apparently
      gratified by her conquest.&mdash;But there was none of the flutter of
      vanity in her manner, nor any of the repressed satisfaction of pride.
      There were in her looks and words only simplicity and dignity.&mdash;She
      said that she was at present occupied happily in various ways,
      endeavouring to improve herself, and that she should be sorry to have her
      mind turned from these pursuits; she desired to secure time to compare and
      judge of her own tastes, and of the characters of others, before she
      should make any engagement, or form an attachment on which the happiness
      of her life must depend. She said she was equally desirous to keep herself
      free, and to avoid injuring the happiness of the man who had honoured her
      by his preference; therefore she requested he would discontinue a pursuit,
      which she could not encourage him to hope would ever be successful.&mdash;Long
      before the time when she should think it prudent to marry, even if she
      were to meet with a character perfectly suited to hers, she hoped that her
      cousin Buckhurst would be united to some woman who would be able to return
      his affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner in which all this was said convinced Buckhurst that she spoke
      the plain and exact truth. From the ease and frankness with which she had
      hitherto conversed with him, he had flattered himself that it would not be
      difficult to prepossess her heart in his favour; but now, when he saw the
      same ease and simplicity unchanged in her manner, he was convinced that he
      had been mistaken. He had still hopes that in time he might make an
      impression upon her, and he urged that she was not yet sufficiently
      acquainted with his character to be able to judge whether or not it would
      suit hers. She frankly told him all she thought of him, and in doing so
      impressed him with the conviction that she had both discerned the merits
      and discovered the defects of his character: she gave him back a
      representation of himself, which he felt to be exactly just, and yet which
      struck him with all the force of novelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is myself," he exclaimed: "but I never knew myself till now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had such pleasure in hearing Caroline speak of him, that he wished even
      to hear her speak of his faults&mdash;of these he would, however, have
      been better pleased, if she had spoken with less calmness and indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is a great way from love as yet," thought Buckhurst. "It is
      astonishing, that with powers and knowledge on all other subjects so far
      above her age, she should know so little even of the common language of
      sentiment; very extraordinary, that with so much kindness, and such an
      amiable disposition, she should have so little sensibility."
    </p>
    <p>
      The novelty of this insensibility, and of this perfect simplicity, so
      unlike all he had observed in the manners and minds of other young ladies
      to whom he had been accustomed, had, however, a great effect upon her
      lover. The openness and unaffected serenity of Caroline's countenance at
      this moment appeared to him more charming than any other thing he had ever
      beheld in the most finished coquette, or the most fashionable beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a divine creature she will be a few years hence! thought he. The time
      will come, when Love may waken this Psyche!&mdash;And what glory it would
      be to me to produce to the world such perfection!
    </p>
    <p>
      With these mixed ideas of love and glory, Buckhurst took leave of
      Caroline; still he retained hope in spite of her calm and decided refusal.
      He knew the power of constant attention, and the display of ardent
      passion, to win the female heart. He trusted also in no slight degree to
      the reputation he had already acquired of being a favourite with the fair
      sex.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Buckhurst Falconer returned to Percy-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came provided with something like an excuse&mdash;he had business&mdash;his
      father had desired him to ask Mr. Percy to take charge of a box of family
      papers for him, as he apprehended that, when he was absent from the
      country, his steward had not been as careful of them as he ought to have
      been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy willingly consented to take charge of the papers, but he desired
      that, before they were left with him, Buckhurst should take a list of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst was unprepared for this task.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head was intent on a ball and on Caroline. However, he was obliged to
      undergo this labour; and when he had finished it, Mr. Percy, who happened
      to be preparing some new leases of considerable farms, was so busy, in the
      midst of his papers, that there was no such thing as touching upon the
      subject of the ball. At length the ladies of the family appeared, and all
      the parchments were at last out of the way&mdash;Buckhurst began upon his
      real business, and said he meant to delay going to town a few days longer,
      because there was to be a ball early in the ensuing week.&mdash;"Nothing
      more natural," said Mr. Percy, "than to wish to go to a ball; yet," added
      he, gravely, "when a man of honour gives his promise that nothing shall
      prevent him from commencing his studies immediately, I did not expect that
      the first temptation&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! my dear Mr. Percy," said Buckhurst, endeavouring to laugh away the
      displeasure, or rather the disappointment which he saw in Mr. Percy's
      countenance, "a few days can make no difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only the difference of a term," said Mr. Percy; "and the difference
      between promising and performing. You thought me unjust yesterday, when I
      told you that I feared you would prefer present amusement to future
      happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amusement!" exclaimed Buckhurst, turning suddenly towards Caroline; "do
      you imagine <i>that</i> is my object?" Then approaching her, he said in a
      low voice, "It is a natural mistake for you to make, Miss Caroline Percy&mdash;for
      you&mdash;who know nothing of love. Amusement! It is not amusement that
      detains me&mdash;can you think I would stay for a ball, unless I expected
      to meet you there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I will not go," said Caroline: "it would be coquetry to meet you
      there, when, as I thought, I had distinctly explained to you yesterday&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! don't repeat that," interrupted Buckhurst: "a lady is never bound to
      remember what she said yesterday&mdash;especially if it were a cruel
      sentence; I hope hereafter you will change your mind&mdash;let me live
      upon hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will never give any false hopes," said Caroline; "and since I cannot
      add to your happiness, I will take care not to diminish it. I will not be
      the cause of your breaking your promise to my father: I will not be the
      means of tempting you to lower yourself in his opinion&mdash;I will not go
      to this ball."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst smiled, went on with some commonplace raillery about cruelty,
      and took his leave, fancying that Caroline could not be in earnest in her
      threat, as he called it.&mdash;As his disobedience would have the excuse
      of <i>love</i>, he thought he might venture to transgress the letter of
      the promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came, he went to the ball, almost certain that Caroline
      would break her resolution, as he knew that she had never yet been at a
      public assembly, and it was natural that one so sure of being admired
      would be anxious to be seen. His surprise and disappointment were great
      when no Caroline appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked Rosamond if her sister was not well?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why is not she here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you recollect her telling you that she would not come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes: but I did not think she was in earnest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How little you know of Caroline," replied Rosamond, "if you imagine that
      either in trifles, or in matters of consequence, <i>she</i> would say one
      thing and do another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel," said Buckhurst, colouring, "what that emphasis on <i>she</i>
      means. But I did not think you would have reproached me so severely. <i>I
      thought</i> my cousin Rosamond was my friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I am&mdash;but not a friend to your faults."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely it is no great crime in a young man to like going to a ball better
      than going to the Temple! But I am really concerned," continued Buckhurst,
      "that I have deprived Miss Caroline Percy of the pleasure of being here
      to-night&mdash;and this was to have been her first appearance in public&mdash;I
      am quite sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Caroline is not at all impatient to appear in public; and as to the
      pleasure of being at a ball, it costs her little to sacrifice that, or any
      pleasure of her own, for the advantage of others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Miss Caroline Percy said something about my falling in her father's
      opinion for such a trifle, I could not guess that she was serious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She does not," replied Rosamond, "think it a trifle to break a promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst looked at his watch. "The mail-coach will pass through this town
      in an hour. It shall take me to London&mdash;Good bye&mdash;I will not
      stay another moment&mdash;I am gone. I wish I had gone yesterday&mdash;pray,
      my dear, good Rosamond, say so for me to Caroline."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a beautiful young lady, attended by a large party, entered
      the ball-room. Buckhurst stopped to inquire who she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you never see my sister before?" replied Colonel Hauton&mdash;"Oh! I
      must introduce you, and you shall dance with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do me a great deal of honour&mdash;I shall be very happy&mdash;that
      is, I should be extremely happy&mdash;only unfortunately I am under a
      necessity of setting off immediately for London&mdash;I'm afraid I shall
      be late for the mail&mdash;Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst made an effort, as he spoke, to pass on; but Colonel Hauton
      bursting into one of his horse laughs, held him fast by the arm, swore he
      must be drunk, for that he did not know what he was saying or doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commissioner Falconer, who now came up, whispered to Buckhurst, "Are you
      mad? You can't refuse&mdash;you'll affront for ever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't help it," said Buckhurst: "I'm sorry for it&mdash;I cannot help
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He still kept on his way towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," expostulated the commissioner, following him out, "you can surely
      stay, be introduced, and pay your compliments to the young lady&mdash;you
      are time enough for the mail. Don't affront people for nothing, who may be
      of the greatest use to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear father, I don't want people to be of use to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, at any rate turn back just to see what a charming creature Miss
      Hauton is. Such an entrée! So much the air of a woman of fashion! every
      eye riveted&mdash;the whole room in admiration of her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not see any thing remarkable about her," said Buckhurst, turning
      back to look at her again. "If you think I should affront&mdash;I would
      not really affront Hauton, who has always been so civil to me&mdash;I'll
      go and be introduced and pay my compliments, since you say it is
      necessary; but I shall not stay five minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst returned to be introduced to Miss Hauton. This young lady was so
      beautiful that she would, in all probability, have attracted general
      attention, even if she had not been the sister of a man of Colonel
      Hauton's fortune, and the niece of a nobleman of Lord Oldborough's
      political consequence; but undoubtedly these circumstances much increased
      the power of her charms over the imaginations of her admirers. All the
      gentlemen at this hall were unanimous in declaring that she was a most
      fascinating creature. Buckhurst Falconer and Godfrey Percy were introduced
      to her nearly at the same time. Godfrey asked her to dance&mdash;and
      Buckhurst could not help staying to see her. She danced so gracefully,
      that while he thought he had stayed only five minutes, he delayed a
      quarter of an hour. Many gentlemen were ambitious of the honour of Miss
      Hauton's hand; but, to their disappointment, she declined dancing any
      more; and though Buckhurst Falconer had determined not to have stayed, nor
      to dance with her, yet an undefinable perverse curiosity induced him to
      delay a few minutes to determine whether she conversed as well as she
      danced. The sound of her voice was sweet and soft, and there was an air of
      languor in her whole person and manner, with an apparent indifference to
      general admiration, which charmed Godfrey Percy, especially as he
      perceived, that she could be animated by his conversation. To Buckhurst's
      wit she listened with politeness, but obviously without interest.
      Buckhurst looked at his watch again&mdash;but it was now too late for the
      mail. Rosamond was surprised to see him still in the ball-room. He laid
      all the blame on his father, and pleaded that he was detained by parental
      orders which he could not disobey. He sat beside Rosamond at supper, and
      used much eloquence to convince her that he had obeyed against his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time Godfrey, seated next to his fair partner, became every
      moment more and more sensible of the advantages of his situation. Towards
      the end of supper, when the buzz of general conversation increased, it
      happened that somebody near Miss Hauton spoke of a marriage that was
      likely to take place in the fashionable world, and all who thought
      themselves, or who wished to be thought good authorities, began to settle
      <i>how</i> it would be, and <i>when</i> it would be: but a gentleman of
      Godfrey's acquaintance, who sat next to him, said, in a low voice, "It
      will never be."&mdash;"Why?" said Godfrey.&mdash;The gentleman answered in
      a whisper, "There is an insuperable objection: the <i>mother</i>&mdash;don't
      you recollect?&mdash;the mother was a <i>divorcée</i>; and no man of sense
      would venture to marry the daughter&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, certainly," said Godfrey; "I did not know the fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned, as he finished speaking, to ask Miss Hauton if she would permit
      him to help her to something that stood before him; but to his surprise
      and alarm he perceived that she was pale, trembling, and scarcely able to
      support herself.&mdash;He, for the first moment, thought only that she was
      taken suddenly ill, and he was going to call Lady Oldborough's attention
      to her indisposition&mdash;but Miss Hauton stopped him, and said in a low,
      tremulous voice&mdash;"Take no notice." He then poured out a glass of
      water, put it within her reach, turned away in obedience to her wishes,
      and sat in such a manner as to screen her from observation. A confused
      recollection now came across his mind of his having heard many years ago,
      when he was a child, of the divorce of some Lady Anne Hauton, and the
      truth occurred to him, that this was Miss Hauton's mother, and that Miss
      Hauton had overheard the whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments, anxious to see whether she had recovered, and yet afraid
      to distress her by his attention, he half turned his head, and looking
      down at her plate, asked if she was better.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite well, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then raised his eyes, and looking as unconcernedly as he could, resumed
      his former attitude, and began some trifling conversation; but whatever
      effort he made to appear the same as before, there was some constraint, or
      some difference in his voice and manner, which the young lady perceived&mdash;her
      voice immediately changed and faltered&mdash;he spoke quickly&mdash;both
      spoke at the same time, without knowing what either said or what they said
      themselves&mdash;their eyes met, and both were silent&mdash;Miss Hauton
      blushed deeply. He saw that his conjecture was right, and she saw, by
      Godfrey's countenance, that her secret was discovered: her eyes fell, she
      grew pale, and instantly fainted. Lady Oldborough came to her assistance,
      but she was too helpless a fine lady to be of the least use: she could
      only say that it must be the heat of the room, and that she should faint
      herself in another moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godfrey whispered to his mother&mdash;and Miss Hauton was carried into the
      open air. Lady Oldborough and her smelling-bottle followed. Godfrey,
      leaving the young lady with them, returned quickly to the supper-room, to
      prevent any one from intruding upon her. He met Buckhurst Falconer and
      Colonel Hauton at the door, and stopped them with assurances that Miss
      Hauton had all the assistance she could want.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you what she wants," cried the Colonel to Buckhurst; "a jaunt
      to Cheltenham, which would do her and me, too, a d&mdash;d deal of good;
      for now the races are over, what the devil shall we do with ourselves
      here? I'll rattle Maria off the day after to-morrow in my phaeton. No&mdash;Buckhurst,
      my good fellow, I'll drive you in the phaeton, and I'll make Lady
      Oldborough take Maria in the coach."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godfrey Percy, who, as he passed, could not avoid hearing this invitation,
      did not stay to learn Buckhurst's answer, but went instantly into the
      room. No one, not even the gentleman whose whisper had occasioned it, had
      the least suspicion of the real cause of Miss Hauton's indisposition. Lady
      Oldborough had assigned as the occasion of the young lady's illness "the
      heat of the room," and an old medical dowager was eager to establish that
      "it was <i>owing</i> to some strawberry ice, as, to her certain knowledge,
      ice, in some shape or other, was the cause of most of the mischief in the
      world."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the partizans of heat and ice were still battling, and whilst the
      dancers had quite forgotten Miss Hauton, and every thing but themselves,
      the young lady returned to the room. Godfrey went to order Mrs. Percy's
      carriage, and the Percy family left the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Godfrey found himself in the carriage with his own family, he began
      eagerly to talk of Miss Hauton; he was anxious to know what all and each
      thought of her, in general, and in particular: he talked so much of her,
      and seemed so much surprised that any body could wish to talk or think of
      any thing else, that Mrs. Percy could not help smiling. Mr. Percy, leaning
      back in the carriage, said that he felt inclined to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To sleep!" repeated Godfrey: "is it possible that you can be sleepy,
      sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very possible, my dear son&mdash;it is past four o'clock, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godfrey was silent for some minutes, and he began to think over every word
      and look that had passed between him and Miss Hauton. He had been only
      amused with her conversation, and charmed by her grace and beauty in the
      beginning of the evening; but the sensibility she had afterwards shown had
      touched him so much, that he was extremely anxious to interest his father
      in her favour. He explained the cause of her fainting, and asked whether
      she was not much to be pitied. All pitied her&mdash;and Godfrey,
      encouraged by this pity, went on to prove that she ought not to be blamed
      for her mother's faults; that nothing could be more unjust and cruel than
      to think ill of the innocent daughter, because her mother had been
      imprudent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Godfrey," said Rosamond, "you seem to be answering some one who has
      attacked Miss Hauton&mdash;whom are you contending with?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With himself," said Mr. Percy. "His prudence tells him that the gentleman
      was quite right in saying that no man of sense would marry the daughter of
      a woman who had conducted herself ill, and yet he wishes to make an
      exception to the general rule in favour of pretty Miss Hauton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty! My dear father, she is a great deal more than pretty: if she were
      only pretty, I should not be so much interested about her. But putting her
      quite out of the question, I do not agree with the general principle that
      a man should not marry the daughter of a woman who has conducted herself
      ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you did agree with it till you knew that it applied to Miss
      Hauton's case," said Mr. Percy: "as well as I remember, Godfrey, I heard
      you once answer on a similar occasion, 'No, no&mdash;I will have nothing
      to do with any of the daughters of that mother&mdash;black cats have black
      kittens'&mdash;or 'black dogs have black puppies'&mdash;I forget which you
      said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whichever it was, I am ashamed of having quoted such a vulgar proverb,"
      said Godfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be a vulgar proverb, but I doubt whether it be a vulgar error,"
      said Mr. Percy: "I have great faith in the wisdom of nations. So much so
      in the present instance, that I own I would rather a son of mine were to
      marry a well-conducted farmer's daughter of <i>honest parentage</i>, than
      the daughter of an ill-conducted lady of rank or fashion. The farmer's
      daughter might be trained into a gentlewoman, and might make my son at
      least a faithful wife, which is more than he could expect, or than I
      should expect, from the young lady, who had early seen the example of what
      was bad, and whose predispositions would be provided with the excuse of
      the old song."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godfrey took fire at this, and exclaimed against the injustice of a
      doctrine which would render wretched for life many young women who might
      possess every amiable and estimable quality, and who could never remedy
      the misfortune of their birth. Godfrey urged, that whilst this would
      render the good miserable, it would be the most probable means of driving
      the weak from despair into vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond eagerly joined her brother's side of the question. Mr. Percy,
      though he knew, he said, that he must appear one of the "fathers with
      flinty hearts," protested that he felt great compassion for the
      unfortunate individuals, as much as a man who was not in love with any of
      them could reasonably be expected to feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But now," continued he, "granting that all the consequences which Godfrey
      has predicted were to follow from my doctrine, yet I am inclined to
      believe that society would, upon the whole, be the gainer by such
      severity, or, as I am willing to allow it to be, such apparent injustice.
      The adherence to this principle would be the misery, perhaps the ruin, of
      a few; but would, I think, tend to the safety and happiness of so many,
      that the evil would be nothing in comparison to the good. The certainty of
      shame descending to the daughters would be a powerful means of deterring
      mothers from ill-conduct; and might probably operate more effectually to
      restrain licentiousness in high life than heavy damages, or the now
      transient disgrace of public trial and divorce. As to the apparent
      injustice of punishing children for the faults of their parents, it should
      be considered that in most other cases children suffer discredit more or
      less for the faults of their parents of whatever kind; and that, on the
      other hand, they enjoy the advantage of the good characters which their
      parents establish. This <i>must</i> be so from the necessary effect of
      experience, and from the nature of human belief, except in cases where
      passion operates to destroy or suspend the power of reason&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not my case, I assure you, sir," interrupted Godfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy smiled, and continued:&mdash;"It appears to me highly
      advantageous, that <i>character</i>, in general, should descend to
      posterity as well as riches or honours, which are, in fact, often the
      representations, or consequences, in other forms, of different parts of
      character&mdash;industry, talents, courage. For instance, in the lower
      ranks of life, it is a common saying, that a good name is the richest
      legacy a woman can leave her daughter. This idea should be impressed more
      fully than it is upon the higher classes. At present, money too frequently
      forms a compensation for every thing in high life. It is not uncommon to
      see the natural daughters of men of rank, or of large fortune, portioned
      so magnificently, either with solid gold, or promised <i>family protection</i>,
      that their origin by the mother's side, and the character of the mother,
      are quite forgotten. Can this be advantageous to good morals? Surely a
      mother living in open defiance of the virtue of her sex should not see her
      illegitimate offspring, instead of being her shame, become her glory.&mdash;On
      the contrary, nothing could tend more to prevent the ill conduct of women
      in high life than the certainty that men who, from their fortune, birth,
      and character, might be deemed the most desirable matches, would shun
      alliances with the daughters of women of tainted reputation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godfrey eagerly declared his contempt for those men who married for money
      or ambition either illegitimate or legitimate daughters. He should be
      sorry, he said, to do any thing that would countenance vice, which ought
      to be put out of countenance by all means&mdash;if possible. But he was
      not the guardian of public morals; and even if he were, he should still
      think it unjust that the innocent should suffer for the guilty. That for
      his own part, if he could put his father's disapprobation out of the
      question, he should easily settle his mind, and overcome all objections in
      a <i>prudential</i> point of view to marrying an amiable woman who had had
      the misfortune to have a worthless mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Percy had not yet given her opinion&mdash;all eyes turned towards
      her. As usual, she spoke with persuasive gentleness and good sense; she
      marked where each had, in the warmth of argument, said more than they
      intended, and she seized the just medium by which all might be
      conciliated. She said that she thought the important point to be
      considered was, what the <i>education</i> of the daughter had been; on
      this a prudent man would form his opinion, not on the mere accident of her
      birth. He would inquire whether the girl had lived with the ill-conducted
      mother&mdash;had been in situations to be influenced by her example, or by
      that of the company which she kept. If such had been the case, Mrs. Percy
      declared she thought it would be imprudent and wrong to marry the
      daughter. But if the daughter had been separated in early childhood from
      the mother, had never been exposed to the influence of her example, had,
      on the contrary, been educated carefully in strict moral and religious
      principles, it would be cruel, because unnecessary, to object to an
      alliance with such a woman. The objection would appear inconsistent, as
      well as unjust, if made by, those who professed to believe in the
      unlimited power of education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godfrey rubbed his hands with delight&mdash;Mr. Percy smiled, and
      acknowledged that he was compelled to admit the truth and justice of this
      statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray do you know, Godfrey," said Rosamond, "whether Miss Hauton lived
      with her mother, or was educated by her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell," said Godfrey; "but I will make it my business to find
      out. At all events, my dear mother," continued he, "a child cannot decide
      by whom she will be educated. It is not her fault if her childhood be
      passed with a mother who is no fit guardian for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I acknowledge," said Mrs. Percy, "that is her misfortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And would you make it an irreparable misfortune?" said Godfrey, in an
      expostulatory tone: "my dear mother&mdash;only consider."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear son, I do consider," said Mrs. Percy; "but I cannot give up the
      point of education. I should be very sorry to see a son of mine married to
      a woman who had been in this unfortunate predicament. But," added Mrs.
      Percy, after a few minutes' silence, "if from the time her own will and
      judgment could be supposed to act, she had chosen for her companions
      respectable and amiable persons, and had conducted herself with uniform
      propriety and discretion, I think I might be brought to allow of an
      exception to my general principle." She looked at Mr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly," said Mr. Percy; "exceptions must not merely be allowed, but
      will force themselves in favour of superior merit, of extraordinary
      excellence, which will rise above every unfavourable circumstance in any
      class, in any condition of life in which it may exist, which will throw
      off any stigma, however disgraceful, counteract all prepossessions,
      however potent, rise against all power of depression&mdash;redeem a family&mdash;redeem
      a race."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, father, you speak like yourself!" cried Godfrey: "this is all I ask&mdash;all
      I wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And here," continued Mr. Percy, "is an adequate motive for a good and
      great mind&mdash;yes, <i>great</i>&mdash;for I believe there are great
      minds in the female as well as in the male part of the creation; I say,
      here is an adequate motive to excite a woman of a good and great mind to
      exert herself to struggle against the misfortunes of her birth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For instance," said Rosamond, "my sister Caroline is just the kind of
      woman, who, if she had been one of these unfortunate daughters, would have
      made herself an exception."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely," said Mr. Percy, laughing; "but why you should go so far out
      of your way to make an unfortunate daughter of poor Caroline, and why you
      should picture to yourself, as Dr. Johnson would say, what would be
      probable in an impossible situation, I cannot conceive, except for the
      pleasure of exercising, as you do upon most occasions, a fine romantic
      imagination."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events <i>I</i> am perfectly satisfied," said Godfrey. "Since you
      admit of exceptions, sir, I agree with you entirely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not entirely. I am sure you cannot agree with me entirely, until I
      admit Miss Hauton to be one of my exceptions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will come in time, if she deserve it," said Mrs. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godfrey thanked his mother with great warmth, and observed, that she was
      always the most indulgent of friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But remember my <i>if</i>," said Mrs. Percy: "I know nothing of Miss
      Hauton at present, except that she is very pretty, and that she has
      engaging manners&mdash;Do you, my dear Godfrey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed, ma'am, I know a great deal more of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever see her before this night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never," said Godfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And at a ball!" said Mrs. Percy: "you must have wonderful penetration
      into character.&mdash;But Cupid, though blindfold, can see more at a
      single glance than a philosophic eye can discover with the most minute
      examination."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Cupid out of the question, let me ask you, mother," said Godfrey,
      "whether you do not think Miss Hauton has a great deal of sensibility? You
      saw that there was no affectation in her fainting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "None, none," said Mrs. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, father!" cried Godfrey, in an exulting tone; "and sensibility is
      the foundation of every thing that is most amiable and charming, of every
      grace, of every virtue in woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Mr. Percy, "and perhaps of some of their errors and vices. It
      depends upon how it is governed, whether sensibility be a curse or a
      blessing to its possessor, and to society."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A curse!" cried Godfrey; "yes, if a woman be doomed&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, my dear Godfrey," interrupted Mr. Percy, "do not let us talk
      any more upon the subject just now, because you are too much interested to
      reason coolly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond then took her turn to talk of what was uppermost in her thoughts&mdash;Buckhurst
      Falconer, whom she alternately blamed and pitied, accused and defended;
      sometimes rejoicing that Caroline had rejected his suit, sometimes pitying
      him for his disappointment, and repeating that with such talents,
      frankness, and generosity of disposition, it was much to be regretted that
      he had not that rectitude of principle, and steadiness of character, which
      alone could render him worthy of Caroline. Then passing from compassion
      for the son to indignation against the father, she observed, "that
      Commissioner Falconer seemed determined to counteract all that was good in
      his son's disposition, that he actually did every thing in his power to
      encourage Buckhurst in a taste for dissipation, as it seemed on purpose to
      keep him in a state of dependence, and to enslave him to the <i>great</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope, with all my heart, I hope," continued Rosamond, "that Buckhurst
      will have sense and steadiness enough to refuse; but I heard his father
      supporting that foolish Colonel Hauton's persuasions, and urging his poor
      son to go with those people to Cheltenham. Now, if once he gets into that
      extravagant, dissipated set, he will be ruined for ever!&mdash;Adieu to
      all hopes of him. He will no more go to the bar than I shall&mdash;he will
      think of nothing but pleasure; he will run in debt again, and then
      farewell principle, and with principle, farewell all hopes of him. But I
      think he will have sense and steadiness enough to resist his father, and
      to refuse to accompany this profligate patron, Colonel Hauton.&mdash;Godfrey,
      what is your opinion? Do you think Buckhurst will go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know," replied Godfrey: "in his place I should find it very
      easy, but in my own case, I confess, I should feel it difficult, to
      refuse, if I were pressed to join a party of pleasure with Miss Hauton."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Godfrey Percy went in the morning to inquire after the health of his fair
      partner: this was only a common civility. On his way thither he overtook
      and joined a party of gentlemen, who were also going to Clermont-park.
      They entered into conversation, and talked of the preceding night&mdash;one
      of the gentlemen, an elderly man, who had not been at the ball, happened
      to be acquainted with Miss Hauton, and with her family. Godfrey heard from
      him all the particulars respecting Lady Anne Hauton, and was thrown into a
      melancholy reverie by learning that Miss Hauton had been educated by this
      mother, and had always lived with her till her ladyship's death, which
      happened about two years before this time.&mdash;After receiving this
      intelligence, Godfrey heard little more of the conversation that passed
      till he reached Clermont-park.&mdash;A number of young people were
      assembled in the music-room practising for a concert.&mdash;Miss Hauton
      was at the piano-forte when he entered the room: she was sitting with her
      back to the door, surrounded by a crowd of amateurs; she did not see him&mdash;he
      stood behind listening to her singing. Her voice was delightful; but he
      was surprised, and not pleased, by the choice of her songs: she was
      singing, with some other high-bred young ladies, songs which, to use the
      gentlest expression, were rather too <i>anacreontic</i>&mdash;songs which,
      though sanctioned by fashion, were not such as a young lady of taste would
      prefer, or such as a man of delicacy would like to hear from his sister or
      his wife. They were nevertheless highly applauded by all the audience,
      except by Godfrey, who remained silent behind the young lady. In the
      fluctuation of the crowd he was pressed nearer and nearer to her chair. As
      she finished singing a fashionable air, she heard a sigh from the person
      behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's your favourite, I think?" said she, turning round, and looking up.
      "Mr. Percy! I&mdash;I thought it was Mr. Falconer." Face, neck, hands,
      suddenly blushed: she stooped for a music-book, and searched for some time
      in that attitude for she knew not what, whilst all the gentlemen
      officiously offered their services, and begged only to know for what book
      she was looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, Maria," cried Colonel Hauton, "what the d&mdash;&mdash; are
      you about?&mdash;Can't you give us another of these? You can't be better.
      Come, you're keeping Miss Drakelow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, Miss Drakelow, if you please, without me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible. Come, come, Maria, what the deuce are you at?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hauton, afraid to refuse her brother, afraid to provoke the comments
      of the company, began to sing, or rather to attempt to sing&mdash;her
      voice faltered; she cleared her throat, and began again&mdash;worse still,
      she was out of tune: she affected to laugh. Then, pushing back her chair,
      she rose, drew her veil over her face, and said, "I have sung till I have
      no voice left.&mdash;Does nobody walk this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said Colonel Hauton; "who the deuce would be <i>bored</i> with
      being broiled at this time of day? Miss Drakelow&mdash;Miss Chatterton,
      give us some more music, I beseech you; for I like music better in a
      morning than at night&mdash;the mornings, when one can't go out, are so
      confoundedly long and heavy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ladies played, and Miss Hauton seated herself apart from the
      group of musicians, upon a <i>bergère</i>, leaning on her hand, in a
      melancholy attitude. Buckhurst Falconer followed and sat down beside her,
      endeavouring to entertain her with some witty anecdote.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled with effort, listened with painful attention, and the moment
      the anecdote was ended, her eyes wandered out of the window. Buckhurst
      rose, vacated his seat, and before any of the other gentlemen who had
      gathered round could avail themselves of that envied place, Miss Hauton,
      complaining of the intolerable heat, removed nearer to the window, to an
      ottoman, one half of which was already so fully occupied by a large dog of
      her brother's, that she was in no danger from any other intruder. Some of
      the gentlemen, who were not blessed with much sagacity, followed, to talk
      to her of the beauty of the dog which she was stroking; but to an eulogium
      upon its long ears, and even to a quotation from Shakspeare about dewlaps,
      she listened with so vacant an air, that her followers gave up the point,
      and successively retired, leaving her to her meditations. Godfrey, who had
      kept aloof, had in the mean time been looking at some books that lay on a
      reading table.&mdash;<i>Maria Hauton</i> was written in the first page of
      several of them.&mdash;All were novels&mdash;some French, and some German,
      of a sort which he did not like.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you there, Mr. Percy?" said Miss Hauton.&mdash;"Nothing worth
      your notice, I am afraid. I dare say you do not like novels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, I like some novels very much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which?" said Miss Hauton, rising and approaching the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that are just representations of life and manners, or of the human
      heart," said Godfrey, "provided they are&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! the human heart!" interrupted Miss Hauton: "the heart only can
      understand the heart&mdash;who, in modern times, can describe the human
      heart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to speak of foreigners&mdash;Miss Burney&mdash;Mrs. Inchbald&mdash;Mrs.
      Opie," said Godfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True; and yet I&mdash;and yet&mdash;" said Miss Hauton, pausing and
      sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet that was not what I was thinking of," she should have said, had
      she finished her sentence with the truth; but this not being convenient,
      she left it unfinished, and began a new one, with "Some of these novels
      are sad trash&mdash;I hope Mr. Godfrey Percy will not judge of my taste by
      them: that would be condemning me for the crimes of my bookseller, who
      will send us down everything new that comes out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godfrey disclaimed the idea of condemning or blaming Miss Hauton's taste:
      "he could not," he said, "be so presumptuous, so impertinent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So then," said she, "Mr. Godfrey Percy is like all the rest of his sex,
      and I must not expect to hear the truth from him."&mdash;She paused&mdash;and
      looked at a print which he was examining.&mdash;"I would, however, rather
      have him speak severely than think hardly of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has no right to speak, and certainly no inclination to think hardly of
      Miss Hauton," replied Godfrey gravely, but with an emotion which he in
      vain endeavoured to suppress. To change the conversation, he asked her
      opinion about a figure in the print. She took out her glass, and stooped
      to look quite closely at it.&mdash;"Before you utterly condemn me,"
      continued she, speaking in a low voice, "consider how fashion silences
      one's better taste and feelings, and how difficult it is when all around
      one&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Chatterton, Miss Drakelow, and some officers of their suite came up
      at this instant; a deputation, they said, to bring Miss Hauton back, to
      favour them with another song, as she must now have recovered her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;no&mdash;excuse me," said she, smiling languidly; "I beg not to
      be pressed any more. I am really not well&mdash;I absolutely cannot sing
      any more this morning. I have already sung so much&mdash;<i>too much</i>,"
      added she, when the deputation had retired, so that the last words could
      be heard only by him for whom they were intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Miss Hauton's apologizing thus for her conduct, and making a young
      gentleman, with whom she was but just acquainted, the judge of her
      actions, might be deemed a still farther proof of her indiscretion, yet
      the condescension was so flattering, and it appeared such an instance of
      ingenuous disposition, that Godfrey was sensibly touched by it. He
      followed the fair Maria to her ottoman, from which she banished Pompey the
      Great, to make room for him. The recollection of his father's warning
      words, however, came across Godfrey's mind; he bowed an answer to a motion
      that invited him to the dangerous seat, and continued standing with an air
      of safe respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you will have the goodness to express to Mrs. Percy how much I
      felt her kindness to me last night, when&mdash;when I wanted it so much.
      There is something so soothing, so gentle, so indulgent about Mrs. Percy,
      so <i>loveable!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is very good, very indulgent, indeed," said Godfrey, in a tone of
      strong affection,&mdash;"very <i>loveable</i>&mdash;that is the exact
      word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear it is not English," said Miss Hauton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Il mérite bien de l'être</i>," said Godfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      A profound silence ensued.&mdash;Colonel Hauton came up to this pair,
      while they were still silent, and with their eyes fixed upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "D&mdash;&mdash;d agreeable you two seem," cried the colonel.&mdash;"Buckhurst,
      you have always so much to say for yourself, do help your cousin here: I'm
      sure I know how to pity him, for many a time the morning after a ball,
      I've been with my partner in just as bad a quandary&mdash;without a word
      to throw to a dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible, surely, colonel, when you had such a fine animal as this,"
      said Godfrey, caressing Pompey, who lay at his feet. "Where did you get
      this handsome dog?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel then entered into the history of Pompey the Great. "I was
      speaking," said Miss Hauton, "to Mr. Godfrey Percy of his family&mdash;relations
      of yours, Mr. Falconer, are not they? He has another sister, I think, some
      one told me, a beautiful sister, Caroline, who was not at the ball last
      night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Buckhurst, who looked at this instant also to the dog for
      assistance&mdash;"Pompey!&mdash;Pompey!&mdash;poor fellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Miss Caroline Percy like her mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like her father&mdash;or her brother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not particularly&mdash;Will you honour me with any commands for town?&mdash;Colonel,
      have you any?&mdash;I'm just going off with Major Clay," said Buckhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not you, indeed," cried the colonel; "your father has made you over to
      me, and I won't give you leave of absence, my good fellow.&mdash;You're
      under orders for Cheltenham to-morrow, my boy&mdash;No reply, sir&mdash;no
      arguing with your commanding officer. You've no more to do, but to tell
      Clay to go without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," continued the colonel, returning to Godfrey Percy, after
      Buckhurst had left the room, "what hinders you from making one of our
      party? You can't do better. There's Maria and Lady Oldborough were both
      wishing it at breakfast&mdash;Maria, can't you say something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria's eyes said more than the colonel could have said, if he had spoken
      for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But perhaps Mr. Godfrey Percy may have other engagements," said she, with
      a timid persuasive tone, which Godfrey found it extremely difficult to
      resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bellamy! where the d&mdash;&mdash;l do you come from?&mdash;Very glad to
      see you, faith!" cried the colonel, going forward to shake hands with a
      very handsome man, who had just then entered the room. "Maria," said
      Colonel Hauton, turning to his sister, "don't you know Bellamy?&mdash;Bellamy,"
      repeated he, coming close to her, whilst the gentleman was paying his
      compliments to Lady Oldborough, "Captain Bellamy, with whom you used to
      waltz every night, you know, at&mdash;what's the name of the woman's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never waltzed with him but once&mdash;or twice, that I remember," said
      Miss Hauton, "and then because you insisted upon it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I!&mdash;Well, I did very right if I did, because you were keeping all
      the world waiting, and I knew you intended to do it at last&mdash;so I
      thought you might as well do it at first. But I don't know what's the
      matter with you this morning&mdash;we must drive a little spirit into you
      at Cheltenham."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Bellamy came up to pay his respects, or rather his compliments, to
      Miss Hauton: there was no respect in his manner, but the confidence of one
      who had been accustomed to be well received.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has not been well&mdash;fainted last night at a ball&mdash;is <i>hipped</i>
      this morning; but we'll get her spirits up again when we have her at
      Cheltenham&mdash;We shall be a famous dashing party! I have been beating
      up for recruits all day&mdash;here's one," said Colonel Hauton, turning to
      Godfrey Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me," said Godfrey, "I am engaged&mdash;I am obliged to join my
      regiment immediately." He bowed gravely to Miss Hauton&mdash;wished her a
      good morning; and, without trusting himself to another look, retreated,
      saying to himself,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Sir, she's yours&mdash;You have brushed from the grape its soft blue;
  From the rosebud you've shaken its tremulous dew:
  What you've touched you may take.&mdash;Pretty waltzer, adieu!"
</pre>
    <p>
      From this moment he mentioned Miss Hauton's name no more in his own
      family. His whole mind now seemed, and not only seemed, but was, full of
      military thoughts. So quickly in youth do different and opposite trains of
      ideas and emotions succeed to each other; and so easy it is, by a timely
      exercise of reason and self-command, to prevent a <i>fancy</i> from
      becoming a passion. Perhaps, if his own happiness alone had been in
      question, Godfrey might not have shown precisely the same prudence; but on
      this occasion his generosity and honour assisted his discretion. He
      plainly saw that Miss Hauton was not exactly a woman whom he could wish to
      make his wife&mdash;and he was too honourable to trifle with her
      affections. He was not such a coxcomb as to imagine that, in the course of
      so slight an acquaintance, he could have made any serious impression on
      this young lady's heart: yet he could not but perceive that she had
      distinguished him from the first hour he was introduced to her; and he was
      aware that, with her extreme sensibility, and an unoccupied imagination,
      she might rapidly form for him an attachment that might lead to mutual
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy rejoiced in his son's honourable conduct, and he was
      particularly pleased by Godfrey's determining to join his regiment
      immediately. Mr. Percy thought it advantageous for the eldest son of a man
      of fortune to be absent for some years from his home, from his father's
      estate, tenants, and dependents, to see something of the world, to learn
      to estimate himself and others, and thus to have means of becoming a
      really respectable, enlightened, and useful country gentleman&mdash;not
      one of those booby squires, born only to consume the fruits of the earth,
      who spend their lives in coursing, shooting, hunting, carousing [Footnote:
      See an eloquent address to country gentlemen, in Young's Annals of
      Agriculture, vol. i., last page.], "who eat, drink, sleep, die, and rot in
      oblivion." He thought it in these times the duty of every young heir to
      serve a few years, that he might be as able, as willing, to join in the
      defence of his country, if necessary. Godfrey went, perhaps, beyond his
      father's ideas upon this subject, for he had an ardent desire to go into
      the army as a profession, and almost regretted that his being an eldest
      son might induce him to forego it after a few campaigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godfrey did not enter into the army from the puerile vanity of wearing a
      red coat and an epaulette; nor to save himself the trouble of pursuing his
      studies; nor because he thought the army a <i>good lounge</i>, or a happy
      escape from parental control; nor yet did he consider the military
      profession as a mercenary speculation, in which he was to calculate the
      chance of getting <i>into the shoes</i>, or over the head, of Lieutenant A&mdash;&mdash;
      or Captain B&mdash;&mdash;. He had higher objects; he had a noble ambition
      to distinguish himself. Not in mere technical phrase, or to grace a bumper
      toast, but in truth, and as a governing principle of action, he felt zeal
      for the interests of the service. Yet Godfrey was not without faults; and
      of these his parents, fond as they were of him, were well aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Percy, in particular, felt much anxiety, when the moment fixed for
      his departure approached; when she considered that he was now to mix with
      companions very different from those with whom he had hitherto associated,
      and to be placed in a situation where calmness of temper and prudence
      would be more requisite than military courage or generosity of
      disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear mother," cried Godfrey, when he came to take leave, "fare
      you well: if I live, I hope I shall distinguish myself; and if I fall&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'How sleep the brave, who sink to rest!'"
</pre>
    <p>
      "God bless you, my dear son!" said his mother. She seemed to have much
      more to say, but, unable at that moment to express it, she turned to her
      husband, who knew all she thought and felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Godfrey," said his father, "I have never troubled you with much
      advice; but now you are going from me, let me advise you to take care that
      the same enthusiasm which makes you think your own country the best
      country upon earth, your own family the best family in that country, and
      your own regiment the best regiment in the service, all which is becoming
      a good patriot, a good son, and a good soldier, should go a step&mdash;a
      dangerous step farther, and should degenerate into party spirit, or what
      the French call <i>esprit-de-corps</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The French!" cried Godfrey. "Oh! hang the French! Never mind what the
      French call it, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And degenerating into party-spirit, or what is called <i>esprit-de-corps</i>,"
      resumed Mr. Percy, smiling, "should, in spite of your more enlarged views
      of the military art and science, and your knowledge of all that Alexander
      and Cæsar, and Marshal Saxe and Turenne, and the Duke of Marlborough and
      Lord Peterborough, ever said or did, persuade you to believe that your
      brother officers, whoever they may be, are the greatest men that ever
      existed, and that their opinions should rule the world, or at least should
      govern you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than all the rest, I fear, my dear Godfrey," interposed Mrs. Percy,
      "that, when you do not find the world so good as you imagine it to be, you
      will, by quarrelling with it directly, make it worse to you than it really
      is. But if you discover that merit is not always immediately rewarded or
      promoted, do not let your indignation, and&mdash;shall I say it&mdash;impatience
      of spirit, excite you to offend your superiors in station, and, by these
      means, retard your own advancement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely, if I should be treated with injustice, you would not have me bear
      it patiently?" cried Godfrey, turning quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, stay till it happens before you take fire," said his
      father; "and, in the next place, remember that patience, and deference to
      his superiors, form an indispensable part of a young soldier's merit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! my dear," said Mrs. Percy, looking up at her son anxiously, "if, even
      at this instant, even with us, even at the bare imagination of injustice,
      you take offence, I fear&mdash;I very much fear&mdash;" said she, laying
      her hand upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dearest mother," said Godfrey, in a softened tone, taking his mother's
      hand in the most respectful and tender manner, "fear nothing for me. I
      will be as patient as a lamb, rather than be a source of anxiety to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, my good friends, fare ye well!" said Godfrey, turning to take
      leave of his sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young soldier departed. His last words, as he got upon his horse, were
      to Caroline. "Caroline, you will be married before I return."
    </p>
    <p>
      But to descend to the common affairs of life. Whilst all these visits and
      balls, coquettings and separations, had been going on, the Dutch
      carpenters had been repairing the wreck; and, from time to time,
      complaints had been made of them by Mr. Percy's old steward. The careful
      steward's indignation was first excited by their forgetting every night to
      lock a certain gate, with the key of which they had been entrusted. Then
      they had wasted his master's timber, and various tools were missing&mdash;they
      had been twice as long as they ought to have been in finishing their work,
      and now, when the wind was fair, the whole ship's crew impatient to sail,
      and not above half a day's work wanting, the carpenters were smoking and
      drinking, instead of putting their hands to the business. The Dutch
      carpenter, who was at this moment more than half intoxicated, answered the
      steward's just reproaches with much insolence. Mr. Percy, feeling that his
      hospitality and good-nature were encroached upon and abused, declared that
      he would no longer permit the Dutchmen to have the use of his house, and
      ordered his steward to see that they quitted it immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      These men, and all belonging to them, consequently left the place in a few
      hours; whatever remained to be done to the vessel was finished that
      evening, and she sailed, to the great joy of her whole crew, and of Mr.
      Percy's steward, who, when he brought the news of this event to his
      master, protested that he was as glad as if any body had given him twenty
      golden guineas, that he had at last got safely rid of these ill-mannered
      drunken fellows, who, after all his master had done for them, never so
      much as said, "thank you," and who had wasted and spoiled more by their
      carelessness than their heads were worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! he little knew at that moment how much more his master was to lose
      by their carelessness, and he rejoiced too soon at having got <i>rid</i>
      of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the night the family were alarmed by the cry of fire!&mdash;A
      fire had broken out in the outhouse, which had been lent to the Dutchmen;
      before it was discovered, the roof was in a blaze; the wind unfortunately
      blew towards a hay-rick, which was soon in flames, and the burning hay
      spread the fire to a considerable distance, till it caught the veranda at
      the east wing of the dwelling-house. One of the servants, who slept in
      that part of the house, was awakened by the light from the burning
      veranda, but by the time the alarm was given, and before the family could
      get out of their rooms, the flames had reached Mr. Percy's study, which
      contained his most valuable papers. Mr. Percy, whose voice all his family,
      in the midst of their terror and confusion, obeyed, directed with great
      presence of mind what should be done by each. He sent one to open a
      cistern of water at the top of the house, and to let it flow over the
      roof, another to tear down the trellis next the part that was on fire;
      others he despatched for barrows-full of wet mortar from a heap which was
      in a back yard near the house; others he stationed in readiness to throw
      the mortar where it was most needful to extinguish the flames, or to
      prevent their communicating with the rest of the building. He went himself
      to the place where the fire raged with the greatest violence, whilst his
      wife and daughters were giving out from the study the valuable papers,
      which, as he directed, were thrown in one heap on the lawn, at a
      sufficient distance from the house to prevent any danger of their being
      burnt&mdash;most of them were in tin cases that were easily removed&mdash;the
      loose papers and books were put into baskets, and covered with wet
      blankets, so that the pieces of the burning trellis, which fell upon them
      as they were carried out, did them no injury. It was wonderful with what
      silence, order, and despatch, this went on whilst three females, instead
      of shrieking and fainting, combined to do what was useful and prudent. In
      spite of all Mr. Percy's exertions, however, the flames burst in from the
      burning trellis through one of the windows of the study, before the men
      could tear down the shutters and architraves, as he had ordered. The fire
      caught the wood-work, and ran along the book-shelves on one side of the
      wall with terrible rapidity, so that the whole room was, in a few minutes,
      in a blaze&mdash;they were forced to leave it before they had carried out
      many of the books. Some old papers remained in the presses, supposed to be
      duplicates, and of no consequence. This whole wing of the house they were
      obliged to abandon to the flames, but the fire was stopped in its progress
      at last, and the principal part of the mansion was preserved by wet
      mortar, according to Mr. Percy's judicious order, by the prompt obedience,
      and by the unanimity, of all who assisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the family saw the melancholy spectacle of a heap of
      ruins in the place of that library which they all loved so much. However,
      it was their disposition to make the best of misfortunes; instead of
      deploring what they had lost, they rejoiced in having suffered so little
      and saved so much. They particularly rejoiced that no lives had been
      sacrificed;&mdash;Mr. Percy declared, that for his own part, he would
      willingly undergo much greater pecuniary loss, to have had the
      satisfaction of seeing in all his family so much presence of mind, and so
      much freedom from selfishness, as they had shown upon this occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he said something of this sort before his servants, who were all
      assembled, it was observed that one of them, a very old nurse, looked
      immediately at Caroline, then lifted up her hands and eyes to heaven, in
      silent gratitude. Upon inquiry it appeared, that in the confusion and
      terror, when the alarm had first been raised, the nurse had been
      forgotten, or it had been taken for granted that she had gone home to her
      own cottage the preceding evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline, however, recollected her, and ran to her room, which was in the
      attic story over the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Caroline opened the door she could scarcely see the bed.&mdash;She
      made her way to it, however, got old Martha out of the room, and with
      great difficulty brought the bewildered, decrepit creature, safely down a
      small staircase, which the flames had not then reached.&mdash;Nothing
      could exceed her gratitude; with eyes streaming with tears, and a head
      shaking with strong emotion, she delighted in relating all these
      circumstances, and declared that none but Miss Caroline could have
      persuaded her to go down that staircase, when she saw all below in flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy's first care was to look over his papers, to see whether any
      were missing.&mdash;To his consternation, one valuable deed, a deed by
      which he held the whole Percy estate, was nowhere to be found. He had
      particular reason for being alarmed by the loss of this paper.&mdash;The
      heir-at-law to this estate had long been lying in wait to make an attack
      upon him.&mdash;Aware of this, Mr. Percy took all prudent means to conceal
      the loss of this paper, and he cautioned his whole family never to mention
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened about this time, that a poor old man, to whom Buckhurst
      Falconer had given that puppy which his brother John had so bitterly
      regretted, came to Mr. Percy to complain that the dog had brought him into
      great trouble. The puppy had grown into a dog, and of this the old man had
      forgotten to give notice to the tax-gatherer. Mr. Percy perceiving clearly
      that the man had no design to defraud, and pitying him for having thus, by
      his ignorance or carelessness, subjected himself to the heavy penalty of
      ten pounds, which, without selling his only cow, he was unable to pay,
      advised him to state the simple fact in a petition, and Mr. Percy promised
      to transmit this petition to government, with a memorial against the
      tax-gatherer, who had been accused, in many instances, of oppressive and
      corrupt conduct. He had hitherto defied all complainants, because he was
      armed strong in law by an attorney who was his near relation&mdash;an
      attorney of the name of Sharpe, whose cunning and skill in the doubles and
      mazes of his profession, and whose active and vindictive temper had
      rendered him the terror of the neighbourhood. Not only the poor but the
      rich feared him, for he never failed to devise means of revenging himself
      wherever he was offended. He one morning waited on Mr. Percy, to speak to
      him about the memorial, which, he understood, Mr. Percy was drawing up
      against Mr. Bates, the tax-gatherer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, Mr. Percy," said he, "you don't know that Mr. Bates is my near
      relation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy replied, that he had not known it; but that now that he did, he
      could not perceive how that altered the business; as he interfered, not
      from any private motive, but from a sense of public justice, which made
      him desire to remove a person from a situation for which he had shown
      himself utterly unfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharpe smiled a malicious smile, and declared that, for his part, he
      did not pretend to be a reformer of abuses: he thought, in the present
      times, that gentlemen who wished well to their king and the peace of the
      country ought not to be forward to lend their names to popular
      discontents, and should not embarrass government with petty complaints.
      Gentlemen could never foresee where such things would end, and therefore,
      in the <i>existing circumstances</i>, they ought surely to endeavour to
      strengthen, instead of weakening, the hands of government.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this commonplace <i>cant</i>, by which all sorts of corruption and all
      public delinquents might be screened, and by which selfishness and fraud
      hope to pass for loyalty and love of the peace of the country, Mr. Percy
      did not attempt, or rather did not deign, any reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharpe then insinuated that Lord Oldborough, who had put Bates into
      his present situation, would be displeased by a complaint against him. Mr.
      Sharpe observed, that Lord Oldborough was remarkable for standing steadily
      by all the persons whom he appointed, and that, if Mr. Percy persisted in
      this attack, he would probably not find himself thanked by his own
      relations, the Falconers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hint produced no effect: so at last Mr. Sharpe concluded, by saying,
      with an air of prodigious legal assurance, that for his own part he was
      quite at ease about the result of the affair, for he was confident that,
      when the matter came to be properly inquired into, and the witnesses to be
      cross-examined, no malpractices could be brought home to his relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Percy observed, that a memorial, praying to have the
      circumstances inquired into, could be no disadvantage to Mr. Bates, but
      the contrary, as it would tend to prove his innocence publicly, and to
      remove the prejudice which now subsisted against him.&mdash;Mr. Percy, who
      had the memorial at this time in his hand, deliberately folded it up, and
      directed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, sir," cried Mr. Sharpe, put off his guard by anger, "since you are
      determined to throw away the scabbard, you cannot be surprised if I do the
      same."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy, smiling, said that he feared no sword but the sword of justice,
      which could not fall on his head, while he was doing what was just. As he
      spoke, he prepared to seal the memorial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharpe's habitual caution recurring in the space of a second or two,
      he begged pardon if zeal for his relation had hurried him into any
      unbecoming warmth of expression, and stretching out his hand eagerly to
      stop Mr. Percy, as he was going to press down the seal, "Give me leave,
      sir," said he, "give me leave to run my eye over that memorial&mdash;may I
      beg? before you seal it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And welcome," said Mr. Percy, putting the paper into his hand: "all that
      I do shall be done openly and fairly."
    </p>
    <p>
      The attorney took possession of the memorial, and began to con it over. As
      he was reading it, he happened to stand in a recessed window, so that he
      could not easily be seen by any person who entered the room: at this
      moment Rosamond came in suddenly, exclaiming, as she held up a huge
      unfolded parchment, "I've found it!&mdash;I've found it, my dear father!&mdash;I
      do believe this is Sir John Percy's deed that was lost!&mdash;I always
      said it was not burned.&mdash;What's the matter?&mdash;What do you mean?&mdash;Nobody
      can hear me? the outer door is shut&mdash;Perhaps this is only a copy.&mdash;It
      is not signed or sealed, but I suppose&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she stopped short, for she saw Mr. Sharpe&mdash;She looked so much
      astounded, that even if he had not heard all she had said, her countenance
      would have excited his curiosity. The attorney had heard every syllable
      she had uttered, and he knew enough of Mr. Percy's affairs to comprehend
      the full extent of the advantage that might be made of this discovery. He
      coolly returned the memorial, acknowledging that it was drawn up with much
      moderation and ability, but regretting that Mr. Percy should think it
      necessary to send it; and concluding with a few general expressions of the
      regard he had always felt for the family, he took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All is safe!" cried Rosamond, as soon as she heard the house door shut
      after he was gone. "All is safe, thank Heaven!&mdash;for that man's head
      was luckily so full of this memorial, that he never heard one word I
      said."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy was of a different opinion: he was persuaded that the attorney
      would not neglect so fine an opportunity of revenge. Sharpe had formerly
      been employed in suits of Sir Robert Percy, the heir-at-law. Here was now
      the promise of a lawsuit, that would at all events put a great deal of
      money into the pockets of the lawyers, and a considerable gratuity would
      be ensured to the person who should first inform Sir Robert of the loss of
      the important conveyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy's opinion of the revengeful nature of Sharpe, and his perception
      that he was in the solicitor's power, did not, however, make any change in
      his resolution about the memorial.&mdash;It was sent, and Bates was turned
      out of his office. For some time nothing more was heard of Mr. Sharpe.&mdash;Mr.
      Percy, for many months afterward, was busied in rebuilding that part of
      his house which had been destroyed by the fire; and as he was naturally of
      a sanguine temper, little inclined to occupy himself with cabals and
      quarrels, the transaction concerning Bates, and even the attorney's threat
      of throwing away the scabbard, passed from his mind. The family pursued
      the happy tenour of their lives, without remembering that there was such a
      being as Mr. Solicitor Sharpe.

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the time of the fire at Percy-hall, a painted glass window in the
      passage&mdash;we should say the gallery&mdash;leading to the study had
      been destroyed.&mdash;Old Martha, whose life Caroline had saved, had a
      son, who possessed some talents as a painter, and who had learnt the art
      of painting on glass. He had been early in his life assisted by the Percy
      family, and, desirous to offer some small testimony of his gratitude, he
      begged permission to paint a new window for the gallery.&mdash;He chose
      for his subject the fire, and the moment when Caroline was assisting his
      decrepit mother down the dangerous staircase.&mdash;The painting was
      finished unknown to Caroline, and put up on her birthday, when she had
      just attained her eighteenth year. This was the only circumstance worth
      recording which the biographer can find noted in the family annals at this
      period. In this dearth of events, may we take the liberty of introducing,
      according to the fashion of modern biography, a few private letters? They
      are written by persons of whom the reader as yet knows nothing&mdash;Mr.
      Percy's second and third sons, Alfred and Erasmus. Alfred was a barrister;
      Erasmus a physician: they were both at this time in London, just
      commencing their professional career. Their characters&mdash;but let their
      characters speak for themselves in their letters, else neither their
      letters nor their characters can be worth attention.

    <p>
      ALFRED PERCY TO HIS FATHER.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR FATHER,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for the books&mdash;I have been reading hard lately, for I have
      still, alas! leisure enough to read. I cannot expect to be employed, or to
      have <i>fees</i> for some time to come. I am armed with patience&mdash;I
      am told that I have got through the worst part of my profession, the
      reading of dry law. This is tiresome enough, to be sure; but I think the
      courting of attorneys and solicitors is the worst part of the beginning of
      my profession: for this I was not, and I believe I never shall be,
      sufficiently prepared. I give them no dinners, and they neglect me; yet I
      hope I pay them proper attention. To make amends, however, I have been so
      fortunate as to form acquaintance with some gentlemen of the bar, who
      possess enlarged minds and general knowledge: their conversation is of the
      greatest use and pleasure to me. But many barristers here are men who live
      entirely among themselves, with their heads in their green bags, and their
      souls narrowed to a point: mere machines for drawing pleas and rejoinders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember Burke asserts (and I was once, with true professional
      party-spirit, angry with him for the assertion) that the study of the law
      has a contractile power on the mind; I am now convinced it has, from what
      I see, and what I feel; therefore I will do all I can to counteract this
      contraction by the expansive force of literature. I lose no opportunity of
      making acquaintance with literary men, and cultivating their society. The
      other day, at Hookham's library, I met with a man of considerable talents&mdash;a
      Mr. Temple: he was looking for a passage in the life of the lord-keeper
      Guildford, which I happened to know. This brought us into a conversation,
      with which we were mutually so well pleased, that we agreed to dine
      together, for further information&mdash;and we soon knew all that was to
      be known of each other's history.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Temple is of a very good family, though the younger son of a younger
      brother. He was brought up by his grandfather, with whom he was a
      favourite. Accustomed, from his childhood, to live with the rich and
      great, to see a grand establishment, to be waited upon, to have servants,
      horses, carriages at his command, and always to consider himself as a part
      of a family who possessed every thing they could wish for in life; he
      says, he almost forgot, or rather never thought of the time when he was to
      have nothing, and when he should be obliged to provide entirely for
      himself. Fortunately for him, his grandfather having early discerned that
      he had considerable talents, determined that he should have all the
      advantages of education, which he thought would prepare him to shine in
      parliament.&mdash;His grandfather, however, died when Temple was yet
      scarcely eighteen.&mdash;He had put off writing a codicil to his will, by
      which Temple lost the provision intended for him.&mdash;All hopes of being
      brought into parliament were over. His uncle, who succeeded to the estate,
      had sons of his own. There were family jealousies, and young Temple, as
      having been a favourite, was disliked.&mdash;Promises were made by other
      relations, and by former friends, and by these he was amused and misled
      for some time; but he found he was only wasting his life, attending upon
      these great relations. The unkindness and falsehood of some, and the
      haughty neglect of others, hurt his high spirit, and roused his strong
      indignation. He, in his turn, neglected and offended, was cast off at
      last, or forgotten by most of the fine promisers.&mdash;At which, he says,
      he has had reason to rejoice, for this threw him upon his own resources,
      and made him exert his own mind.&mdash;He applied, in earnest, to prepare
      himself for the profession for which he was best fitted, and went to the
      bar.&mdash;Now comes the part of his history for which he, with reason,
      blames himself. He was disgusted, not so much by the labour, as by the
      many disagreeable circumstances, which necessarily occur in the beginning
      of a barrister's course.&mdash;He could not bear the waiting in the
      courts, or on circuit, without business, without notice. He thought his
      merit would never make its way, and was provoked by seeing two or three
      stupid fellows pushed on by solicitors, or helped up by judges.&mdash;He
      had so much knowledge, talent, and eloquence, that he must in time have
      made a great figure, and would, undoubtedly, have risen to the first
      dignities, had he persevered; but he sacrificed himself to pique and
      impatience. He quitted the bar, and the very summer after he had left it,
      the illness of a senior counsel on that circuit afforded an opportunity
      where Temple would have been called upon, and where he could fully have
      displayed his talents. Once known, such a man would have been always
      distinguished.&mdash;He now bitterly regrets that he abandoned his
      profession.&mdash;This imprudence gave his friends a fair excuse for
      casting him off; but, he says, their neglect grieves him not, for he had
      resolved never more to trust to their promises, or to stoop to apply to
      them for patronage. He has been these last two years in an obscure garret
      writing for bread. He says, however, that he is sure he is happier, even
      in this situation, than are some of his cousins at this instant, who are
      struggling in poverty to be genteel, or to keep up a family name, and he
      would not change places with those who are in a state of idle and
      opprobrious dependence. I understand (remember, this is a secret between
      ourselves)&mdash;I understand that <i>Secretary</i> Cunningham Falconer
      has found him out, and makes <i>good use of his pen</i>, but pays him
      shabbily. Temple is too much of a man of honour to <i>peach</i>. So Lord
      Oldborough knows nothing of the matter; and Cunningham gets half his
      business done, and supplies all his deficiencies, by means of this poor
      drudging genius. Perhaps I have tired you with this history of my new
      friend; but he has interested me extremely:&mdash;he has faults certainly,
      perhaps too high a spirit, too much sensibility; but he has such strict
      integrity, so much generosity of mind, and something so engaging in his
      manners, that I cannot help loving, admiring, and pitying him&mdash;that
      last sentiment, however, I am obliged to conceal, for he would not bear
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see very little of Erasmus. He has been in the country this fortnight
      with some patient. I long for his return.&mdash;I will make the inquiries
      you desire about Buckhurst Falconer.

      LETTER FROM ERASMUS TO HIS FATHER.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR FATHER,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray do not feel disappointed when I tell you that I am not getting on
      quite so fast as I expected. I assure you, however, that I have not
      neglected any honourable means of bringing myself into notice. But it is
      very difficult for a young man to rise without puffing, or using low
      means.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I met Lady Jane Granville a few days ago. She gave me a note to Sir Amyas
      Courtney, a fashionable physician and a great favourite of hers.&mdash;She
      told me that he had formerly been acquainted with some of my family, and
      she so strongly urged me to wait upon him, that to avoid offending her
      ladyship, I promised to avail myself of her introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I called several times before I found Sir Amyas at home. At last, by
      appointment, I went to breakfast with him one morning when he was confined
      to the house by an <i>influenza</i>. He received me in the most courteous
      manner&mdash;recollected to have danced with my mother years ago, at a
      ball at Lord Somebody's&mdash;professed the greatest respect for the name
      of Percy&mdash;asked me various questions about my grandfather, which I
      could not answer, and paid you more compliments than I can remember. Sir
      Amyas is certainly the prettiest behaved physician breathing, with the
      sweetest assortment of tittle-tattle, with an inexhaustible fund of
      anecdotes and compliments for the great, and an intimate acquaintance with
      the fair and fashionable. He has also the happiest art of speaking a vast
      deal, and yet saying nothing; seeming to give an opinion, without ever
      committing himself.&mdash;The address with which he avoids contested
      points of science, and the art with which he displays his superficial
      knowledge, and conceals his want of depth, is truly amusing. He slid away
      from science as soon as he could, to politics, where he kept safe in
      commonplace newspaper-phrases; and in the happy persuasion that every
      thing is for the best, and that every man in power, let him be of what
      party he may, can do no wrong. He did not seem quite satisfied with my
      countenance as he spoke, and once or twice paused for my acquiescence&mdash;in
      vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were interrupted by the entrance of a Mr. Gresham, a rich merchant,
      who came to look at a picture which Sir Amyas shows as a true Titian. Mr.
      Gresham spoke, as I thought, with much good sense and taste about it, and
      Sir Amyas talked a great deal of amateur-nonsense. Still in the same
      namby-pamby style, and with the same soft voice and sweet smile, Sir Amyas
      talked on of pictures and battles, and carnage and levees, and
      drawing-rooms and balls, and butterflies.&mdash;He has a museum for the
      ladies, and he took me to look at it.&mdash;Sad was the hour and luckless
      was the day!&mdash;Among his shells was one upon which he peculiarly
      prided himself, and which he showed me as an unique. I was, I assure you,
      prudently silent till he pressed for my opinion, and then I could not
      avoid confessing that I suspected it to be a <i>made</i> shell&mdash;<i>made</i>,
      Caroline knows how, by the application of acids. The countenance of Sir
      Amyas clouded over, and I saw that I at this moment lost all chance of his
      future favour. He made me some fine speeches, when I was going away, and
      dwelt upon his great desire to oblige any friend of Lady Jane Granville's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A few days afterwards, I saw her ladyship again, and found, by her
      manner, that she had not been satisfied by Sir Amyas Courtney's report of
      me. She pressed me to tell her all that had passed between us. She was
      provoked by my imprudence, as she called it, about the shell, and exhorted
      me to repair it by future attentions and complaisance. When I declined
      paying court to Sir Amyas, as inconsistent with my ideas and feelings of
      independence, her ladyship grew angry&mdash;said that my father had
      inspired all his sons with absurd notions of independence, which would
      prevent their rising in the world, or succeeding in any profession. I
      believe I then grew warm in defence of my father and myself. The
      conclusion of the whole was, that we remained of our own opinions, and
      that her ladyship protested she would never more attempt to serve us.
      Alfred has called since on Lady Jane, but has not been admitted. I am
      sorry that I too have offended her, for I really like her, and am grateful
      for her kindness, but I cannot court her patronage, nor bend to her idol,
      Sir Amyas.&mdash;

      LETTER FROM ERASMUS PERCY TO HIS FATHER.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR FATHER,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you in my last how I lost all hopes of favour from Sir Amyas
      Courtney, and how determined I was not to bend to him.&mdash;On some
      occasion soon afterwards this determination appeared, and recommended me
      immediately to the notice of a certain Dr. Frumpton, who is the antagonist
      and sworn foe to Sir Amyas.&mdash;Do you know who Dr. Frumpton is&mdash;and
      who he was&mdash;and how he has risen to his present height?
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was a farrier in a remote county: he began by persuading the country
      people in his neighbourhood that he had a specific for the bite of a mad
      dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It happened that he cured an old dowager's favourite waiting-maid who had
      been bitten by a cross lap-dog, which her servants pronounced to be mad,
      that they might have an excuse for hanging it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fame of this cure was spread by the dowager among her numerous
      acquaintance in town and country.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he took agues&mdash;and afterwards scrofula&mdash;under his
      protection; patronized by his old dowager, and lucky in some of his
      desperate quackery, Dr. Frumpton's reputation rapidly increased, and from
      different counties fools came to consult him. His manners were bearish
      even to persons of quality who resorted to his den; but these brutal
      manners <i>imposed</i> upon many, heightened the idea of his confidence in
      himself, and commanded the submission of the timid.&mdash;His tone grew
      higher and higher, and he more and more easily bullied the credulity of
      man and woman-kind.&mdash;It seems that either extreme of soft and
      polished, or of rough and brutal manner, can succeed with certain
      physicians.&mdash;<i>Dr.</i> Frumpton's name, and Dr. Frumpton's wonderful
      cures, were in every newspaper, and in every shop-window. No man ever
      puffed himself better even in this puffing age.&mdash;His success was
      viewed with scornful yet with jealous eyes by the regularly bred
      physicians, and they did all they could to keep him down&mdash;Sir Amyas
      Courtney, in particular, who would never call him any thing but <i>that
      farrier</i>, making what noise he could about Frumpton's practising
      without a diploma. In pure spite, Frumpton took to learning&mdash;late as
      it was, he put himself to school&mdash;with virulent zeal he read and <i>crammed</i>
      till, Heaven knows how! he accomplished getting a diploma&mdash;stood all
      prescribed examinations, and has grinned defiance ever since at Sir Amyas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frumpton, delighted with the story of the <i>made shell</i>, and
      conceiving me to be the enemy of his enemy, resolved, as he declared, to
      take me by the hand; and, such is the magical deception of self-love, that
      his apparent friendliness towards me made him appear quite agreeable, and
      notwithstanding all that I had heard and known of him, I fancied his
      brutality was frankness, and his presumption strength of character.&mdash;I
      gave him credit especially for a happy instinct for true merit, and an
      honourable antipathy to flattery and meanness.&mdash;The manner in which
      he pronounced the words, <i>fawning puppy!</i> applied to Sir Amyas
      Courtney, pleased me peculiarly&mdash;and I had just exalted Frumpton into
      a great man, and an original genius, when he fell flat to the level, and
      below the level of common mortals.
    </p>

      "It happened, as I was walking home with him, we were stopped in the
      street by a crowd, which had gathered round a poor man, who had fallen
      from a scaffold, and had broken his leg. Dr. Frumpton immediately said,
      'Send for Bland, the surgeon, who lives at the corner of the street.' The
      poor man was carried into a shop; we followed him. I found that his leg,
      besides being broken, was terribly bruised and cut. The surgeon in a few
      minutes arrived. Mr. Bland, it seems, is a <i>protégé</i> of Frumpton's,
      who formerly practised human farriery under him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Bland, after slightly looking at it, said, 'the leg must come off,
      the sooner the better.' The man, perceiving that I pitied him, cast such a
      beseeching look at me, as made me interpose, impertinently perhaps, but I
      could not resist it. I forget what I said; but I know the sense of it was,
      that I thought the poor fellow's leg could and ought to be saved.&mdash;I
      remember Dr. Frumpton glared upon me instantly with eyes of fury, and
      asked how I dared to interfere in a surgical case; and to contradict his
      friend, Mr. Bland, a surgeon!
    </p>
    <p>
      "They prepared for the operation&mdash;the surgeon whipped on his mittens&mdash;the
      poor man, who was almost fainting with loss of blood, cast another piteous
      look at me, and said, in an Irish accent, 'Long life to you, dear!&mdash;and
      don't let'm&mdash;for what will I be without a leg? And my wife and
      children!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "He fell back in a swoon, and I sprung between the surgeon and him;
      insisting that, as he had appealed to me, he should be left to me; and
      declared that I would have him carried to St. George's Hospital, where I
      knew he would be taken care of properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frumpton stamped, and scarcely articulate with rage, bade me&mdash;'stir
      the man at your peril!' adding expressions injurious to the hospital, with
      the governors of which he had some quarrel. I made a sign to the workmen
      who had brought in the wounded man; they lifted him instantly, and carried
      him out before me; and one of them, being his countryman, followed, crying
      aloud, '<i>Success</i> to your honour! and may you <i>never</i> want a <i>friend</i>!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frumpton seized him by both shoulders, and pushing him out of the house,
      exclaimed, 'Success, by G&mdash;&mdash;, he shall never have, if I can
      help it! He has lost a friend such as he can never get again&mdash;By G&mdash;,
      I'll make him repent this!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unmoved by these denunciations, I pursued my way to the hospital. You
      know in what an admirable manner the London hospitals are conducted.&mdash;At
      St. George's this poor man was received, and attended with the greatest
      care and skill. The surgeon who has taken charge of him assures me that
      his leg will, a month hence, be as useful as any leg in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Frumpton and Mr. Bland have, I find, loudly complained of my
      interference, as contrary to all medical etiquette&mdash;<i>Etiquette!</i>&mdash;from
      Frumpton!&mdash;The story has been told with many exaggerations, and
      always to my disadvantage.&mdash;I cannot, however, repent.&mdash;Let me
      lose what I may, I am satisfied with the pleasure of seeing the poor man
      in a way to do well. Pray let me hear from you, my dear father, and say,
      if you can, that you think me right&mdash;Thank Caroline for her letter.

      "ERASMUS PERCY."
    </p>
    <p>
      LETTER FROM ALFRED.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear father, I have made all possible inquiries about Buckhurst
      Falconer. He stayed at Cheltenham till about a month ago with the Hautons,
      and I hear attended Miss Hauton every where: but I do not think there is
      any reason to believe the report of his paying his addresses to her. The
      public attention he showed her was, in my opinion, designed only to pique
      Caroline, whom, I'm persuaded, he thinks (between the fits of half-a-dozen
      other fancies) the first of women&mdash;as he always calls her. Rosamond
      need not waste much pity on him. He is an out-of-sight-out-of-mind man.
      The pleasure of the present moment is all in all with him.&mdash;He has
      many good points in his disposition; but Caroline had penetration enough
      to see that his character would never suit hers; and I rejoice that she
      gave him a decided refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since he came to town, he has, by his convivial powers, his good stories,
      good songs, and knack of mimicry, made himself so <i>famous</i>, that he
      has more invitations to dinner than he can accept. He has wit and talents
      fit for more than being the buffoon or mocking-bird of a good dinner and a
      pleasant party; but he seems so well contented with this <i>réputation de
      salon</i>, that I am afraid his ambition will not rise to any thing
      higher. After leading this idle life, and enjoying this cheap-earned
      praise, he will never submit to the seclusion and application necessary
      for the attainment of the great prizes of professional excellence. I doubt
      whether he will even persevere so far as to be called to the bar; though
      the other day when I met him in Bond-street, he assured me, and bid me
      assure you, that he is getting on <i>famously</i>, and eating his terms
      with a prodigious appetite. He seemed heartily glad to see me, and
      expressed warm gratitude for your having saved his conscience, and having
      prevented his father from forcing him, as he said, to be a disgrace to the
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosamond asks what sort of girls the Miss Falconers are, and whether the
      Falconers have been civil to me since I settled in town?&mdash;Yes; pretty
      well. The girls are mere <i>show</i> girls&mdash;like a myriad of others&mdash;sing,
      play, dance, dress, flirt, and <i>all that</i>. Georgiana is <i>beautiful
      sometimes</i>; Arabella, <i>ugly always</i>. I don't like either of them,
      and they don't like me, for I am not an eldest son. The mother was
      prodigiously pleased with me at first, because she mistook me for Godfrey,
      or rather she mistook me for the heir of our branch of the Percys. I hear
      that Mrs. Falconer has infinite address, both as a political and hymeneal
      <i>intrigante</i>: but I have not time to study her. Altogether, the
      family, though they live in constant gaiety, do not give me the idea of
      being happy among one another. I have no particular reason for saying
      this. I judge only from the tact on this subject which I have acquired
      from my own happy experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love to Rosamond&mdash;I am afraid she will think I have been too severe
      upon Buckhurst Falconer. I know he is a favourite, at least a <i>protégé</i>
      of hers and of Godfrey. Bid her remember I have acknowledged that he has
      talents and generosity; but that which interests Rosamond in his favour
      inclines ill-natured me against him&mdash;his being one of Caroline's
      suitors. I think he has great assurance to continue, in spite of all
      repulse, to hope, especially as he does nothing to render himself more
      worthy of encouragement. Thank Caroline for her letter; and assure
      Rosamond, that, though I have never noticed it, I was grateful for her
      entertaining account of M. de Tourville's <i>vis</i>: I confess, I am
      rather late with my acknowledgments; but the fire at Percy-hall, and many
      events which rapidly succeeded, put that whole affair out of my head.
      Moreover, the story of Euphrosyne and Count Albert was so squeezed under
      the seal, that I must beg notes of explanation in her next. Who the deuce
      is Euphrosyne? and what does the letter P&mdash;for the rest of the word
      was torn out&mdash;stand for? and is Count Albert a hero in a novel, or a
      real live man?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw a live man yesterday, whom I did not at all like to see&mdash;Sharpe,
      walking with our <i>good</i> cousin, Sir Robert Percy, in close
      conversation. This conjunction, I fear, bodes us no good.&mdash;Pray, do
      pray make another search for <i>the deed</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your affectionate son,
    </p>
    <p>
      "ALFRED PERCY."
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this letter had been received, and while the picture of his
      life, and the portraits of his worthy companions were yet fresh in her
      view, Buckhurst Falconer took the unhappy moment to write to renew his
      declaration of passionate attachment to Caroline, and to beg to be
      permitted to wait upon her once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the indignant blush which mounted in Caroline's face on reading his
      letter, Rosamond saw how unlikely it was that this request should be
      granted. It came, indeed, at an unlucky time. Rosamond could not refrain
      from a few words of apology, and looks of commiseration for Buckhurst; yet
      she entirely approved of Caroline's answer to his letter, and the steady
      repetition of her refusal, and even of the strengthened terms in which it
      was now expressed. Rosamond was always prudent for her friends, when it
      came to any serious point where their interests or happiness were
      concerned. Her affection for her friends, and her fear of doing wrong on
      such occasions, awakened her judgment, and so controlled her imagination,
      that she then proved herself uncommonly judicious and discreet.&mdash;Prudence
      had not, it is true, been a part of Rosamond's character in childhood;
      but, in the course of her education, a considerable portion of it had been
      infused by a very careful and skilful hand. Perhaps it had never
      completely assimilated with the original composition: sometimes the
      prudence fell to the bottom, sometimes was shaken to the top, according to
      the agitation or tranquillity of her mind; sometimes it was so faintly
      visible, that its existence might be doubted by the hasty observer; but
      when put to a proper test, it never failed to reappear in full force.&mdash;After
      any effort of discretion in conduct, Rosamond, however, often relieved and
      amused herself by talking in favour of the imprudent side of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have decided prudently, my dear Caroline, I acknowledge," said she.
      "But now your letter is fairly gone; now that it is all over, and that we
      are safe, I begin to think you are a little too prudent for your age.&mdash;Bless
      me, Caroline, if you are so prudent at eighteen, what will you be at
      thirty? Beware!&mdash;and in the mean time you will never be a heroine&mdash;what
      a stupid uninteresting heroine you will make! You will never get into any
      <i>entanglements</i>, never have any adventures; or if kind fate should,
      propitious to my prayer, bring you into some charming difficulties, even
      then we could not tremble for you, or enjoy all the luxury of pity,
      because we should always know that you would be so well able to extricate
      yourself&mdash;so certain to conquer, or&mdash;not die&mdash;but endure.&mdash;Recollect
      that Doctor Johnson, when his learned sock was off, confessed that he
      could never be thoroughly interested for Clarissa, because he knew that
      her prudence would always be equal to every occasion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Percy began to question whether Johnson had ever expressed this
      sentiment seriously: she reprobated the cruelty of <i>friendly</i>
      biographers, who publish every light expression that escapes from
      celebrated lips in private conversation; she was going to have added a
      word or two about the injury done to the public, to young people
      especially, by the spreading such rash dogmas under the sanction of a
      great name.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rosamond did not give her mother time to enforce this moral; she went
      on rapidly with her own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Caroline, my dear," continued she, "you shall not be my heroine; you are
      too well proportioned for a heroine&mdash;in mind, I mean: a heroine may&mdash;<i>must</i>
      have a finely-proportioned person, but never a well-proportioned mind. All
      her virtues must be larger than the life; all her passions those of a
      tragedy queen. Produce&mdash;only dare to produce&mdash;one of your
      reasonable wives, mothers, daughters, or sisters on the theatre, and you
      would see them hissed off the stage. Good people are acknowledged to be
      the bane of the drama and the novel&mdash;I never wish to see a reasonable
      woman on the stage, or an unreasonable woman off it. I have the greatest
      sympathy and admiration for your true heroine in a book; but I grant you,
      that in real life, in a private room, the tragedy queen would be too much
      for me; and the novel heroine would be the most useless, troublesome,
      affected, haranguing, egotistical, insufferable being imaginable! So, my
      dear Caroline, I am content, that you are my sister, and my friend, though
      I give you up as a heroine."

      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      LETTER FROM GODFREY PERCY TO MRS. PERCY.
    </p>
    <p>
      "London, the British Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be surprised, my dear mother, to find that I am in London,
      instead of being, as I had hoped I should have been by this time, with the
      army on the continent. Just as we were going to embark, we were
      countermanded, and ordered to stay at our quarters. Conceive our
      disappointment&mdash;to remain in garrison at the most stupid, idle
      country town in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ask how I like my brother officers, and what sort of men they are?&mdash;Major
      Gascoigne, son to my father's friend, I like extremely; he is a man of a
      liberal spirit, much information, and zeal for the army. But what I
      particularly admire in him is his candour. He says it is his own fault
      that he is not higher in the army&mdash;that when he was a very young man,
      he was of too unbending a temper&mdash;mistook bluntness for sincerity&mdash;did
      not treat his superior officer with proper deference&mdash;lost a good
      friend by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fine lesson for me! and the better, because not intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next to Gascoigne I like Captain Henry: a young man of my own age,
      uncommonly handsome, but quite free from conceit. There is something in
      his manners so gentlemanlike, and he is of so frank a disposition, that I
      was immediately prepossessed in his favour.&mdash;I don't like him the
      worse for having a tinge of proper pride, especially in the circumstances
      in which he is placed. I understand that it is suspected he is not of a
      good family; but I am not impertinent enough to inquire into particulars.
      I have been told, that when he first came into the regiment, some of the
      officers wanted to make out what family he belongs to, and whether he is,
      or is not, one of the Irish Henrys. They showed their curiosity in an
      unwarrantable manner; and Henry, who has great feeling, and a spirit as
      quick to resent injury as to be won by kindness, was going to call one of
      these gentlemen to account for his impertinence. He would have had half a
      dozen duels upon his hands, if Gascoigne had not settled them. I have not
      time to tell you the whole story&mdash;but it is enough to say, that Major
      Gascoigne showed great address and prudence, as well as steadiness, and
      you would all love Captain Henry for his gratitude&mdash;he thinks
      Gascoigne a demi-god.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rest of my brother-officers are nothing supernatural&mdash;just what
      you may call mere red coats; some of them fond of high play, others fond
      of drinking: so I have formed no intimacy but with Gascoigne and Henry. My
      father will see that I do not <i>yet</i> think that the officers of my own
      mess must all be the first men in the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love to all at home. I hope we shall sail soon, and I hope Rosamond will
      give me credit for the length of this letter.&mdash;She cannot say, with
      all her malice, that my lines are at <i>shooting distance</i>, or that my
      words are stretched out like a lawyer's&mdash;two good pages, count which
      way you will!&mdash;and from Godfrey, who is not a letter-writer, as
      Alfred is!&mdash;Two good pages, did I say? why, here's the best part of a
      third for you, if you allow me to be,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "My dear mother,
      with much respect,
    "Your dutiful, obedient,
        and affectionate son,
          "GODFREY PERCY."
</pre>
    <p>
      Whilst Godfrey remained in quarters at this most idle and stupid of
      country towns, some circumstances occurred in the regiment which put his
      prudence to trial, and, sooner than he expected, called upon him for the
      exercise of that spirit of forbearance and temper which he had promised
      his mother he would show.&mdash;It was the more difficult to him to keep
      his temper, because it was an affair which touched the interest of his
      friend Major Gascoigne. The lieutenant-colonel of the regiment having been
      promoted, Major Gascoigne had reasonable expectations of succeeding him;
      but, to his disappointment, a younger man than himself, and a stranger to
      the regiment, was put over his head. It was said that this appointment was
      made in consequence of the new colonel being a nephew of Lord Skreene, and
      of his also having it in his power to command two votes in parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the truth of this story we cannot pretend to vouch. But the credit the
      report gained in the regiment created great discontents, which the
      behaviour of the new lieutenant-colonel unfortunately was not calculated
      to dissipate.&mdash;He certainly did not bear his honours meekly, but, on
      the contrary, gave himself airs of authority, and played the martinet to a
      useless and ridiculous degree. This, from a mere <i>parade officer</i>,
      who had never been out of London, to a man like the major&mdash;who had
      seen service and could show wounds&mdash;was, to use the mildest
      expression, ill-judged. Captain Henry said it was <i>intolerable</i>&mdash;and
      Godfrey thought so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every parade day something unpleasant occurred, and, when it was talked
      over, some of the officers took part with Gascoigne, and some with the
      lieutenant-colonel&mdash;very few, however, with the latter&mdash;only
      those who wanted to <i>keep in</i> favour: officers in quarters as these
      were, had not much to do; therefore they had the more time for disputes,
      which became of more and more consequence every hour. Major Gascoigne
      behaved incomparably well, never failing in respect towards his superior
      officer when he was present, and when he was absent doing all that was
      possible to restrain the imprudent zeal and indignation of his young
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when Godfrey, Captain Henry, and Major Gascoigne were together,
      the major actually knelt down to Henry, to prevail upon him to give up a
      mad design of challenging his colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      That very day, not an hour afterwards, the lieutenant-colonel took
      occasion to thwart the major about some circumstance of no consequence.
      Godfrey's blood boiled in his veins&mdash;his promise to his mother, that
      he would be as gentle as a lamb, he recollected at this instant&mdash;with
      difficulty he restrained himself&mdash;still his blood boiled. Major
      Gascoigne's fear that Godfrey and Henry should embroil themselves for his
      sake increased, for he saw what passed in their hearts, and he had no
      peace of mind by day, or rest by night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generous people are, of all others, the most touched by generosity, either
      of feeling or action. In this state of irritation, it was not possible
      that things should long go on without coming to a crisis. Major Gascoigne
      proposed, as the measure that would be most likely to restore and preserve
      peace, to quit the regiment.&mdash;It was a great sacrifice on his part,
      and, at first, none of his friends would consent to his making it; but, at
      last, he brought them all to acknowledge that it was, upon the whole, the
      best thing that could be done. Gascoigne had a friend, a major in another
      regiment then in England, who was willing to make an exchange with him,
      and he thought that the business could be arranged without much
      difficulty. However, from caprice, the love of showing his power, or from
      some unknown reason, the lieutenant-colonel made it his pleasure to oppose
      the exchange, and said that it could not be done; though, as Captain Henry
      said, every body knew, that by his writing a line to Lord Skreene it would
      have been accomplished directly. It now recurred to Godfrey, that
      Cunningham Falconer, being secretary to Lord Oldborough, might be of use
      in this affair. Cunningham had always professed the greatest regard for
      Godfrey, and he was determined, at least, to make this trial of his
      sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary sent a civil answer in an official style, explaining <i>that
      his office was not the War Office</i>; concluding by an assurance, that if
      Captain Percy could point out how he could do so with propriety, nothing
      could give Mr. C. Falconer greater pleasure than to have an opportunity of
      obliging him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Captain Percy, having a sort of generous good faith about him,
      believed this last assurance; fancied that as he was no great writer he
      had not explained himself well by letter, and that he should make
      Cunningham understand him better <i>viva voce</i>. Keeping his own
      counsel, and telling only Major Gascoigne and Captain Henry his object, he
      asked for a fortnight's leave of absence, and, with some difficulty
      obtained it. He went to London, waited on Secretary Falconer, and found
      him ten times more <i>official</i> in his style of conversation than in
      his letters. Godfrey recollected that his cousin Cunningham had always
      been solemnly inclined, but now he found him grown so mysterious, that he
      could scarcely obtain a plain answer to the simplest question. "The whole
      man, head and heart, seemed," as Godfrey said, "to be diplomatically
      closed." It was clear, from the little that Cunningham did articulate,
      that he would do nothing in furthering the exchange desired for Major
      Gascoigne; but whether this arose from his having no influence with Lord
      Oldborough, or from his fear of wearing it out, our young officer could
      not determine. He left the secretary in disgust and despair, and went to
      wait on Commissioner Falconer, who gave him a polite invitation to dinner,
      and overwhelmed him with professions of friendship; but, as soon as
      Godfrey explained his business, the commissioner protested that he could
      not venture to speak to Lord Oldborough on such an affair, and he
      earnestly advised him not to interest himself so much for Major Gascoigne,
      who, though doubtless a very deserving officer, was, in fact, nothing
      more. He next had recourse to Buckhurst Falconer, and asked him to
      persuade Colonel Hauton to speak to his uncle upon the subject. This
      Buckhurst immediately promised to do, and kept his promise. But Colonel
      Hauton swore that his uncle never, on any occasion, listened to his
      representations; therefore it was quite useless to speak to him. After
      wandering from office to office, wasting hour after hour, and day after
      day, waiting for people who did him no good when he did see them, Godfrey
      at last determined to do what he should have done at first&mdash;apply to
      Lord Oldborough. It is always better to deal with principals than with
      secondaries. Lord Oldborough had the reputation of being inaccessible,
      haughty, and peremptory in the extreme; the secretaries, clerks, and
      under-clerks, "trembled at his name, each under each, through all their
      ranks of venality." But to Captain Percy's surprise, the moment his name
      was announced, the minister immediately recognized him, and received him
      most graciously. His lordship inquired after his old friend, Mr. Percy&mdash;said
      that Mr. Percy was one of the few really independent men he had ever
      known. "Mr. Percy is an excellent country gentleman, and, for England's
      sake, I wish there were many, many more such. Now, sir, how can I serve
      his son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      With frankness and brevity which suited the minister and the man, Godfrey
      told his business, and Lord Oldborough, with laconic decision, equally
      pleasing to the young soldier, replied, "that if it was possible, the
      thing should be done for Major Gascoigne"&mdash;inquired how long Captain
      Percy purposed to stay in town&mdash;desired to see him the day before he
      should leave London, and named the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the diplomacy of Cunningham Falconer's face could not disguise his
      astonishment when he saw the manner in which his master treated Godfrey.&mdash;The
      next day the commissioner invited Captain Percy in a pressing manner to
      dine with him: "We shall have a very pleasant party," said Mr. Falconer,
      "and Mrs. Falconer insists upon the pleasure of your company&mdash;you
      have never seen my girls since they were children&mdash;your own near
      relations!&mdash;you must be better acquainted: come&mdash;I will take no
      denial."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godfrey willingly accepted the invitation: he would, <i>perhaps</i>, have
      found means to have excused himself, had he known whom he was to meet at
      this dinner&mdash;Miss Hauton&mdash;the dangerous fair one, whom he had
      resolved to avoid. But he was in the room with her, and beyond all power
      of receding, before he knew his peril. The young lady looked more
      beautiful than ever, and more melancholy. One of the Miss Falconers took
      an opportunity of telling him, in confidence, the cause of her poor
      friend's dejection. "Her uncle, Lord Oldborough, wants to marry her to the
      Marquis of Twickenham, the eldest son of the Duke of Greenwich, and Miss
      Hauton can't endure him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis was also at this dinner&mdash;Godfrey did not much wonder at
      the lady's dislike; for he was a mean, peevish-looking man, had no
      conversation, and appeared to be fond of drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Lord Oldborough, who is all for ambition," whispered Miss Falconer,
      "and who maintains that there is no such thing as love, except in novels,
      says, that his niece may read foolish novels after marriage as well as
      before, if she pleases, but that she must marry like a reasonable woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godfrey pitied her; and, whilst he was pitying, Mrs. Falconer arranged a
      party for the opera for this night, in which Godfrey found himself
      included. Perhaps he was imprudent; but he was a young man, and human
      nature is&mdash;human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the opera Godfrey felt his danger increase every moment. Miss Hauton
      was particularly engaging, and many circumstances conspired to flatter his
      vanity, and to interest him for this fair victim of ambition. Her marquis
      was in the box, smelling of claret, and paying his <i>devoirs</i> to his
      intended bride, apparently very little to her satisfaction. Commissioner
      Falconer, leaning forward, complimented Miss Hauton upon her appearance
      this night, and observed that though it was a new opera, all fashionable
      eyes were turned from the stage to Lady Oldborough's box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hauton smiled civilly upon the commissioner, then turning to Godfrey,
      in a low soft voice, repeated,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "And ev'n when fashion's brightest arts decoy,
  The heart distrusting asks, if this be joy?"
</pre>
    <p>
      Godfrey was touched&mdash;she saw it, and sighed. A short time afterwards
      her marquis left the box. Miss Hauton recovered from her languor, and
      became animated in conversation with Godfrey. He felt the whole power of
      her charms, the immediate force of the temptation; but he recollected who
      she was&mdash;he recollected that she had not shown any instances of
      discretion which could redeem her from the consequences of a mother's
      disgrace: the songs he had heard from Miss Hauton's lips, Captain Bellamy
      and the <i>waltzing</i>, came full upon his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said he to himself, "as a wife I cannot think of her: were the
      Marquis of Twickenham out of the question, my wife she cannot be. Then
      honour forbids me to trifle with her affections merely to gratify my
      vanity or the feelings of the moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Percy well knew that some men can satisfy their consciences by
      calling a certain sort of treachery by the soft name of gallantry. He was
      aware that he could, like many others in similar circumstances, deceive by
      equivocal looks and expressions, and then throw the blame from themselves,
      by asking why the woman was such a fool as to believe, protesting that
      they never had a thought of her, and swearing that they had not the least
      idea she had ever understood them to mean any thing serious; but Godfrey
      had too much good feeling and good principle to follow such examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hauton had a copy of the new opera before her, and as she turned over
      the leaves, she pointed out to him the passages that she liked. Some were
      peculiarly applicable to her own situation, representing a heroine forced
      to marry a man she hates, whilst she tenderly loves another. Godfrey could
      not, or would not, understand the Italian. It was perfectly well explained
      to him; and then, perceiving the applications made of certain lines by
      Miss Hauton's voice and eyes, he had no resource but in a new singer, to
      whom he became suddenly so attentive that nothing could distract him from
      the stage. When the actress ceased to sing, he found means to engage the
      Miss Falconers in a discussion of her merits, which, with all the nonsense
      and compliments to their taste the occasion required, filled up the
      dangerous interval till the opera was over; then&mdash;more dangerous
      still&mdash;waiting for carriages in <i>the crush room</i>; but through
      all these perils, Godfrey passed so dexterously, as to leave Miss Hauton
      in doubt whether she had been understood or not. Thus he hoped that her
      conscience would in future, if she should ever after her marriage reflect
      on the opera of this night, be as much at ease as his own&mdash;though
      perhaps not with so good reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this night, Godfrey would not expose himself to a repetition of
      similar danger; and that he might avoid meeting this fair lady again, he
      refused two invitations from Mrs. Falconer to a ball at her house, and to
      a musical party.&mdash;This deserves to be recorded to his credit, because
      he was very fond both of music and dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before he was to leave town, at the hour and minute appointed,
      Godfrey waited upon Lord Oldborough; but not such his reception now as it
      had been on his first visit to this minister: he was kept two hours
      waiting alone in an antechamber. At last the cabinet door opened, and Lord
      Oldborough appeared with a dark cold countenance, and a haughty stiffness
      in his whole frame. His lordship walked deliberately forward, till he came
      within a yard of our young officer, and then, without speaking, bent his
      head and body slowly, and so remained, as if waiting to be informed who
      Captain Percy was, and what his business might be. Astonishment, and
      offended pride, flashed successively in Godfrey's countenance. Lord
      Oldborough, after fixing his interrogating eyes upon him ineffectually,
      receiving no explanation, seemed to come a little to his recollection, and
      condescended to say, "Captain Percy, I believe!&mdash;your commands with
      me, Captain Percy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, I have the honour to be here by your lordship's appointment on
      Major Gascoigne's business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, you had a note from me yesterday, I believe, which contained all
      that I have it in my power to say on Major Gascoigne's business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, my lord&mdash;I never had the honour of receiving any note
      from your lordship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very extraordinary! I sent it by my own man. You are at Batts' hotel,
      sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my lord, at the British hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!&mdash;that is the cause of the mistake. You will find my note, sir,
      at Batts'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Percy bowed&mdash;Lord Oldborough bowed&mdash;not a word more
      passed. Lord Oldborough walked on to his carriage, which rolled him away
      with glorious rapidity, whilst Godfrey, his face flushed with resentment,
      looked after him for an instant, then putting on his hat, which the porter
      held to him, he walked off as fast as possible to Batts' hotel, impatient
      to see the note which was to explain the meaning of this extraordinary
      conduct. The note he found; but it threw little light upon the business.
      It was written in Secretary Cunningham Falconer's hand, and was as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Oldborough will inform Captain Percy when any thing shall be decided
      upon relative to the business on which Captain Percy spoke to Lord
      Oldborough: and as communication by letter will answer every purpose, his
      lordship hopes that he shall not be the means of detaining Captain Percy
      longer from his regiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Tuesday</i>, &mdash;&mdash;."
    </p>
    <p>
      A civil dismission!&mdash;After three attempts Godfrey obtained a sight of
      Secretary Cunningham, who, as he thought, was at the bottom of the affair;
      but this suspicion was at first dissipated by the unusual openness with
      which the secretary looked and spoke. Apparently without fear of
      committing himself, he said at once that it was a very extraordinary
      proceeding&mdash;that he could no way account for it, but by supposing
      that the lieutenant-colonel in question had, through his relation, Lord
      Skreene, influenced his Grace of Greenwich, and that Lord Oldborough could
      not, in the present conjuncture, make any movement in direct opposition to
      the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In all these things, in all transactions with politicians," said Godfrey,
      "there are wheels within wheels, which we simple people never suspect; and
      by awkwardly interfering with them when they are in motion, we are hurt,
      we know not how or why."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham smiled significantly, but was silent&mdash;his air of frankness
      vanished, and his solemn reserve returned. "Cunningham will never be hurt
      in that way," thought Godfrey; "I never saw a fellow so careful of
      himself. I am convinced he would not hazard his little finger to save the
      whole British empire, much less to serve a private friend like me, or a
      poor honest man like Gascoigne."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godfrey was too proud to make any further attempts to interest his
      diplomatic cousin in the affair. He rose, and bade the secretary adieu,
      who, with proper smiles and bows, attended him to the very door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank Heaven!" thought Godfrey, as he left the secretary's office, "I am
      not forced to dance attendance upon any great man, or any great man's
      secretary. I am&mdash;like my father&mdash;independent, and will keep
      myself so; and if ever I live upon a smile for years, it shall not be upon
      the smiles of a minister, but on those of a fair lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godfrey left town immediately, and returned to his regiment.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Little versed in the ways of courts or courtiers, Godfrey had been easily
      deceived by the apparent candour of Cunningham Falconer. The fact was,
      that Cunningham, not directly from himself, but by means of persons of
      whom Lord Oldborough could have no suspicion, had insinuated to his
      lordship that Godfrey Percy was the secret cause of the aversion Miss
      Hauton showed to the proposed match with the Marquis of Twickenham. This
      idea once suggested was easily confirmed by the account of the young
      lady's behaviour at the opera, which was reported to Lord Oldborough with
      proper exaggerations, and with a total misrepresentation of Godfrey's
      conduct. The fainting at the ball was also recollected, and many other
      little circumstances combined to bring conviction to Lord Oldborough's
      mind. He was now persuaded that Major Gascoigne's business was merely a
      pretence for Godfrey's coming to town: apprehension of being disappointed
      in completing an alliance essential to his ambitious views, pique at the
      idea of being deceived, and nearly duped by a boy and girl, a rooted
      hatred and utter contempt for love and love affairs, altogether produced
      that change in Lord Oldborough's manner towards Captain Percy which had
      appeared so extraordinary.&mdash;Had Captain Percy delayed to leave town,
      he would next day have received orders from his commanding officer to join
      his regiment. As to Major Gascoigne's business, it had made so little
      impression upon Lord Oldborough, that he had totally forgotten the poor
      major's name till Godfrey repeated it to him. Indeed, Godfrey himself
      could scarcely have blamed his lordship for this, had he known how much
      business, how many cares pressed at this time upon the mind of the unhappy
      statesman.&mdash;Besides a load of public business, and all the open and
      violent attacks of opposition, which he had usually to sustain, he was now
      under great and increasing anxiety from the discovery of that plot against
      him, among his immediate associates in office, which the Tourville papers,
      deciphered by Commissioner Falconer and Cunningham, had but partially
      revealed. Lord Oldborough was in the condition of a person apprised that
      he is standing upon ground that is undermined, but who does not know
      exactly by what hand or at what moment the train that may destroy him is
      to be set on fire. One word frequently recurred in the Tourville papers,
      which puzzled Commissioner Falconer extremely, and of which he was never
      able to make out the meaning; the word was Gassoc. It was used thus: "We
      are sorry to find that the Gassoc has not agreed to our proposal."&mdash;"No
      answer has been given to question No. 2 by the Gassoc."&mdash;"With regard
      to the subsidy, of which 35,000<i>l.</i> have not been sent or received,
      the Gassoc has never explained; in consequence, great discontents here."&mdash;"If
      the Gassoc be finally determined against the <i>Eagle</i>, means must be
      taken to accomplish the purposes alluded to in paragraph 4, in green (of
      the 7th ult.), also those in No. B. in lemon juice (of September last)."&mdash;"The
      Gassoc will take notes of the mining tools forgotten&mdash;also bullets
      too large, and no flints (as per No. 9, in sympathetic ink)&mdash;also the
      sea charts, sent instead of maps&mdash;consequent delay in march of troops&mdash;loss
      of fortress&mdash;to be attributed to <i>the Eagle</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Eagle</i>, which at first had been taken for granted to be the
      Austrian eagle, was discovered to be Lord Oldborough. An eagle was his
      lordship's crest, and the sea-charts, and the mining-tools, brought the
      sense home to him conclusively. It was plain that the Gassoc stood for
      some person who was inimical to Lord Oldborough, but who it could be was
      the question. Commissioner Falconer suggested, that for <i>Gassoc</i>, you
      should read <i>Gosshawk</i>; then, said he, "by finding what nobleman or
      gentleman has a gosshawk in his arms, you have the family name, and the
      individual is afterwards easily ascertained." To the Heralds'-office the
      commissioner went a gosshawking, but after spending a whole day with the
      assistance of Garter king at arms, he could make nothing of his gosshawks,
      and he gave them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He next presumed that there might be a mistake of one letter in the
      foreign spelling of the word, and that <i>Gassoc</i> should be <i>Cassock</i>,
      and might then mean a certain bishop, who was known to be a particular
      enemy of Lord Oldborough. But still there were things ascribed to the
      Gassoc, which could not come within the jurisdiction or cognizance of the
      Cassock&mdash;and the commissioner was reluctantly obliged to give up the
      church. He next suggested, that not only one letter, but every letter in
      the word might be mistaken in the foreign spelling, and that <i>Gassoc</i>
      might be the French or German written imitation of the oral sound of some
      English proper name. The commissioner supported this opinion very
      plausibly by citing many instances of the barbarous spelling of English
      names by foreigners: Bassompierre writes Jorchaux for York-house,
      Innimthort for Kensington; even in the polite memoirs of le Comte de
      Grammont, we have Soutkask for Southesk, and Warméstre for some English
      name not yet deciphered. Upon this hint the commissioner and Cunningham
      made anagrams of half the noble names in England, but in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, recollecting that it was the fashion at one time even to pun
      in the coats of arms of the nobility, and in the choice of their mottos,
      he went to work again at the Heralds'-office, and tried a course of puns,
      but to no purpose: the commissioner was mortified to find all his
      ingenuity at fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham took care not to suggest anything, therefore he could never be
      convicted of mistake. Nor was he in the least vexed by his father's or his
      own fruitless labour, because he thought it might tend to his future
      advancement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough had thrown out a hint that it would soon be necessary to
      recall the present and send a new envoy or resident to the German court in
      question; Cunningham nourished a hope of being chosen for this purpose, as
      the Tourville papers were already known to him, and he could, under
      private instructions, negotiate with M. de Tourville, and draw from him an
      explanation. He did not, however, trust even his father with the hope he
      had conceived, but relied on his own address, and continually strove, by
      oblique hints, to magnify the danger of leaving any part of the plot
      unravelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      What effect these suggestions produced, or whether they produced any,
      Cunningham was unable to judge from the minister's impenetrable
      countenance. Lord Oldborough lost not a moment in repairing the mistake
      about sea-charts, and the omission of mining tools, which he had
      discovered from a paragraph in the Tourville papers; he stayed not to
      inquire whether the error had been wilful or unintentional&mdash;<i>that</i>
      he left for future investigation. His next object was the subsidy. This
      day the Duke of Greenwich gave a cabinet dinner. After dinner, when the
      servants had retired, and when none of the company were prepared for such
      a stroke, Lord Oldborough, in his decided, but very calm manner, began
      with, "My lords, I must call your attention to an affair of some
      importance&mdash;the subsidy from the secret service to our German ally."
    </p>
    <p>
      All who had within them sins unwhipped of justice trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have learned, no matter how," continued Lord Oldborough, "that, by some
      strange mistake, 35,000<i>l</i> of that subsidy were not remitted at the
      time appointed by us, and that discontents, likely to be prejudicial to
      his majesty's service, have arisen in consequence of this delay."
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship paused, and appeared to take no notice of the faces of
      feigned astonishment and real consciousness by which he was surrounded.
      Each looked at the other to inquire by what means this secret was
      divulged, and to discover, if possible, how much more was known. Lord
      Skreene began at the same moment with the Duke of Greenwich to suggest
      that some clerk or agent must certainly be much to blame. Lord Oldborough,
      in his decided tone, replied that it was indifferent to him what clerk,
      agent, or principal was to blame in the business; but that if the money
      were not <i>bonâ fide</i> remitted, and acknowledged by the court to which
      it was promised, and before any disagreeable consequences should ensue, he
      must be under the necessity of stating the affair to his majesty&mdash;of
      resigning his office, and bringing the whole before parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terror of his voice, and lightning of his eye, the dread of his
      determined spirit, operated powerfully. The subsidy was remitted the next
      day, though at the expense of a service of plate which Lord Skreene had
      bespoken for his mistress, and though Secretary Cope was compelled to sell
      at some disadvantage a few of the very few remaining acres of his paternal
      estate, to make good what had been borrowed from the secret service money.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the cabinet dinner, the keen eye of Lord Oldborough had discerned some
      displeasure lurking in the mind of the Duke of Greenwich&mdash;a man of
      considerable political consequence from his rank and connexions, and from
      the number of voices he could command or influence. Lord Oldborough knew
      that, if he could regain the duke, he could keep in awe his other enemies.
      His grace was a puzzle-headed, pompous fool, whom Heaven had cursed with
      the desire to be a statesman. He had not more than four ideas; but to
      those four, which he conceived to be his own, he was exclusively attached.&mdash;Yet
      a person of address and cunning could put things into his head, which
      after a time he would find there, believe to be his own, and which he
      would then propose as new with great solemnity, and support with much
      zeal. Lord Oldborough, however, was neither able nor willing to manage his
      grace in this manner; he was too imperious; his pride of character was at
      continual variance with the duke's pride of rank. The duke's was a sort of
      pride which Lord Oldborough did not always understand, and which, when he
      did, he despised&mdash;it was a species of pride that was perpetually
      taking offence at trifling failures in etiquette, of which Lord
      Oldborough, intent upon great objects, was sometimes guilty. There is a
      class of politicians who err by looking for causes in too high a sphere,
      and by attributing the changes which perplex states and monarchs to great
      passions and large motives. Lord Oldborough was one of this class, and
      with all his talents would have failed in every attempt to comprehend and
      conciliate the Duke of Greenwich, had he not been assisted by the inferior
      genius of Commissioner Falconer. While his lordship was thus searching far
      and wide among the reasonable and probable causes for the duke's coldness,
      examining and re-examining the bearings of every political measure, as it
      could affect his grace's interest immediately or remotely, Commissioner
      Falconer sought for the cause, and found it in the lowest scale of trifles&mdash;he
      made the discovery by means which Lord Oldborough could not have devised,
      and would not have used. The duke had a favourite under-clerk, who, for a
      valuable consideration, disclosed the secret to the commissioner. Lord
      Oldborough had sent his grace a note, written in his own hand, sealed with
      a wafer. The clerk, who was present when the note was received, said that
      the duke's face flushed violently, and that he flung the note immediately
      to his secretary, exclaiming, "Open that, if you please, sir&mdash;<i>I
      wonder how any man can have the impertinence to send me his spittle!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      This nice offence, which bore so coarse a comment, had alienated the mind
      of the Duke of Greenwich. When Commissioner Falconer had thus sagaciously
      discovered the cause of the noble duke's displeasure, he with great
      address applied a remedy. Without ever hinting that he knew of the
      offensive circumstance, having some business to transact with the duke, he
      contrived, as if undesignedly, to turn the conversation upon his friend
      Lord Oldborough's strange and unaccountable negligence of common forms and
      etiquette; as a proof of which he told the duke in confidence, and in a
      very low voice, an anecdote, which he heard from his son Cunningham, from
      Lord Oldborough's own secretary, or the commissioner protested that he
      would not, he could not have believed it&mdash;his lordship had been once
      actually upon the point of sealing a note with a wafer to one of the royal
      dukes!&mdash;had the wafer absolutely on his lips, when Cunningham felt it
      his duty to take the liberty of remonstrating. Upon which, Lord
      Oldborough, as Commissioner Falconer said, looked with the utmost
      surprise, and replied, "I have sealed with a wafer to the Duke of
      Greenwich, and <i>he</i> was not offended."
    </p>
    <p>
      This anecdote, the truth of which it fortunately never occurred to the
      duke to doubt, had an immediate and powerful effect upon his mind, as the
      commissioner saw by the complacent smile that played on his countenance,
      and still further by the condescending pity with which his grace observed,
      that "Great geniuses never understand common things&mdash;but do every
      thing awkwardly, whether they cut open a book, or seal a note."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Falconer having thus brought the duke into fine temper, left him in
      the best dispositions possible towards Lord Oldborough, went to his
      lordship to report progress, and to boast of his success; but he told only
      as much of what had passed as he thought would suit the statesman's
      character, and ensure his approbation.&mdash;The Duke of Greenwich was as
      much pleased by this reconciliation as Lord Oldborough; for, though in a
      fit of offended pride he had been so rash as to join his lordship's
      enemies, yet he had always dreaded coming to open war with such an
      adversary. His grace felt infinitely more safe and comfortable when he was
      leaning upon Lord Oldborough than when he stood opposed to him, even in
      secret. There were points in politics in which he and Lord Oldborough
      coincided, though they had arrived at these by far different roads. They
      agreed in an overweening love of aristocracy, and in an inclination
      towards arbitrary power; they agreed in a hatred of innovation; they
      agreed in the principle that free discussion should be discouraged, and
      that the country should be governed with a high and strong hand. On these
      principles Lord Oldborough always acted, but seldom spoke, and the Duke of
      Greenwich continually talked, but seldom acted: in fact, his grace,
      "though he roared so loud, and looked so wondrous grim," was, in action,
      afraid of every shadow. Right glad was he to have his political vaunts
      made good by a coadjutor of commanding talents, resource, and civil
      courage. Yet, as Lord Oldborough observed, with a man of such wayward
      pride and weak understanding, there was no security from day to day for
      the permanence of his attachment. It was then that Commissioner Falconer,
      ever ready at expedients, suggested that an alliance between his grace's
      family and his lordship's would be the best possible security; and that
      the alliance might be easily effected, since it was evident of late that
      the Marquis of Twickenham was much disposed to admire the charms of his
      lordship's niece, Miss Hauton. Lord Oldborough had not remarked that the
      marquis admired any thing but good wine; his lordship's attention was not
      turned to these things, nor had he, in general, much faith in friendships
      founded on family alliances; but he observed that the duke was peculiarly
      tenacious of connexions and relationships, and, therefore, this might be
      the best method of holding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment Lord Oldborough decided in favour of this scheme, Mr. and
      Mrs. Falconer had done all in their power, with the utmost zeal and
      address, to forward it, by contriving continual dancing-parties and
      musical meetings, at their house, for the young people. Lady Oldborough,
      who was sickly, whose manners were not popular, and who could not bear <i>to
      be put out of her way</i>, was quite unsuited to this sort of business,
      and rejoiced that the Falconers took it off her hands. Things were just in
      this state, and Lord Oldborough had fixed his mind upon the match, when
      Godfrey Percy's arrival in town had threatened disappointment. In
      consequence of this fear, Lord Oldborough not only despatched Godfrey
      directly to his regiment, but, to put an end to the danger at once, to
      banish the idea of seeing him again completely out of the young lady's
      head, the cruel uncle and decided politician had Godfrey's regiment
      ordered immediately to the West Indies.

    <p>
      LETTER FROM GODFREY PERCY TO HIS FATHER.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear father,
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have a new lieutenant-colonel. Lord Skreene has removed his precious
      nephew to another regiment, and to punish us for not liking the pretty
      boy, has ordered us all off to the West Indies: so ends our croaking. Our
      new King Log we cannot complain of as too young, or too much on the <i>qui
      vive</i>: he looks as if he were far gone in a lethargy, can hardly keep
      himself awake while he is giving the word of command, and, instead of
      being a martinet, I am sure he would not care if the whole corps wore
      their regimentals the wrong side outwards.&mdash;Gascoigne will have all
      the regimental business on his shoulders, and no man can do it better.&mdash;He
      is now at my elbow, supplying four hundred men and forty officers with
      heads. The noise of questions and commands, and the notes of preparation,
      are so loud and dissonant, that I hardly know what I write. Gascoigne,
      though not benefited, was obliged to me for my wrong-head-journey to
      London. Henry was very angry with Lord Oldborough for jilting me&mdash;Gascoigne
      with much ado kept him in proper manners towards the lieutenant-colonel,
      and I, in admiration of Gascoigne, kept my temper miraculously. But there
      was an impertinent puppy of an ensign, a partisan of the
      lieutenant-colonel, who wanted, I'm convinced, to have the credit of
      fighting a duel for the colonel, and he one day said, in Captain Henry's
      hearing, that 'it was no wonder some men should rail against ministerial
      <i>influence</i>, who had no friends to look to, and were men of no
      family.'&mdash;'Do you mean that for me, sir?' said Henry. 'Judge for
      yourself, sir.' Poor Henry judged ill, and challenged the ensign.&mdash;They
      fought, and the ensign was slightly wounded. This duel has wakened
      curiosity again about Captain Henry's birth, and he is in danger of being
      exposed continually to things he could not like, and could not well
      resent. He consulted Gascoigne and me, and has told us all he knows of his
      history.&mdash;Read what follows to yourself, for I have permission to
      speak of his affairs only to you. Captain Henry assured us that he really
      does not know to what family he belongs, nor who his father and mother
      were; but he has reason to believe that they were Irish. He was bred up in
      a merchant's house in Dublin. The merchant broke, and went off with his
      family to America. Henry was at that time fifteen or sixteen. The merchant
      then said, that Henry was not his nephew, nor any relation to him, but
      hinted that he was the son of a Mr. Henry, who had taken an unfortunate
      part in <i>the troubles</i> of Ireland, and who had <i>suffered</i>&mdash;that
      his mother had been a servant-maid, and that she was dead. The merchant
      added, that he had taken care of Henry from regard to his father, but
      that, obliged by his own failure in business to quit the country, he must
      thenceforward resign the charge.&mdash;He farther observed, that the army
      was now the young man's only resource, and, on taking leave, he put into
      Henry's hands a 50<i>l.</i> note, and an ensign's commission.&mdash;With
      his commission he joined his regiment, which was at Cork. A few days after
      his arrival, a Cork banker called upon him, and inquired whether he was
      Ensign Charles Henry; and upon his answering in the affirmative, informed
      him that he had orders to pay him 400<i>l.</i> a year in quarterly
      payments. The order came from a house in Dublin, and this was all the
      banker knew. On Henry's application in Dublin, he was told that they had
      direction to stop payment of the annuity if any questions were asked.&mdash;Of
      course, Henry asked no more.&mdash;The annuity has been regularly paid to
      him ever since&mdash;When he was scarcely seventeen, he was pillaged of a
      couple of hundred pounds one night by a set of sharpers at the
      gaming-table: this loss roused his prudence, and he has never played
      since. He has for many years lived within his pay; for he prudently
      considered, that the extraordinary supply might suddenly fail, and then he
      might be left in debt and distress, and at the same time with habits of
      extravagance.&mdash;Instead of which, he has laid up money every year, and
      has a considerable sum. He wishes to quit the army, and to go into a
      mercantile house, for which his early education has fitted him. He has a
      particular talent for languages: speaks French and Italian accurately&mdash;Spanish
      and Dutch well enough for all the purposes of commerce. So any mercantile
      house, who wants a partner, agent, or <i>clerk for foreign affairs</i>
      (perhaps I am not correct in the technical terms), could not do better
      than to take Charles Henry. For his integrity and honour I would answer
      with my life. Now, my dear father, could you have the goodness to assist
      us so far as to write and inquire about the partner in London of those
      Dutch merchants, whom you had an opportunity of obliging at the time of
      the shipwreck?&mdash;I cannot recollect their strange names, but if I am
      not mistaken, they left you their address, and that of their London
      correspondent.&mdash;If this partner should be a substantial man, perhaps
      our best plan would be to try to get Henry into his house. You have
      certainly some claim there, and the Dutchmen desired we would apply to
      them if ever they could do any thing to serve us&mdash;we can but try. I
      am afraid you will say, '<i>This is like one of Godfrey's wild schemes.</i>'
      I am still more afraid that you should think Henry's romantic story is <i>against
      him</i>&mdash;but such things are&mdash;that is all I can say. Here is no
      motive for deception; and if you were to see the young man, his
      countenance and manner would immediately persuade you of his perfect truth
      and ingenuousness. I am aware that his romantic history would not do for
      the Dutch merchants, or the London partner; they would probably set him
      down directly for an adventurer, and refuse to have any thing to do with
      him: so I see no necessity for beginning by stating it. I know you hate,
      and I am sure so do I, all novel-like concealments and mysteries; but
      because a man makes a bargain with another, he is not obliged to tell him
      his whole history&mdash;because he takes him for his partner or his
      master, he is not called upon to make him his confidant. All that the
      merchants can want or have a right to know is forthcoming and clear&mdash;character
      and money.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough expected that the prompt measure of despatching the
      dangerous Godfrey to the West Indies would restore things to their former
      train. For a week after Godfrey Percy's departure, Miss Hauton seemed much
      affected by it, and was from morning till night languid or in the sullens:
      of all which Lord Oldborough took not the slightest notice. In the course
      of a fortnight Miss Falconer, who became inseparable from Miss Hauton,
      flattering, pitying, and humouring her, contrived to recover the young
      lady from this fit of despondency, and produced her again at musical
      parties. She was passionately fond of music; the Miss Falconers played on
      the piano-forte and sung, their brother John accompanied exquisitely on
      the flute, and the Marquis of Twickenham, who was dull as "the fat weed
      that grows on Lethe's brink," stood by&mdash;admiring. His proposal was
      made in form&mdash;and in form the young lady evaded it&mdash;in form her
      uncle, Lord Oldborough, told her that the thing must be, and proceeded
      directly to decide upon the settlements with the Duke of Greenwich, and
      set the lawyers to work. In the mean time, the bride elect wept, and
      deplored, and refused to eat, drink, or speak, except to the Miss
      Falconers, with whom she was closeted for hours, and to whom the task of
      managing her was consigned by common consent. The marquis, who, though he
      was, as he said, much in love, was not very delicate as to the possession
      of the lady's affections, wondered that any one going to be married to the
      Marquis of Twickenham could be so shy and so melancholy; but her
      confidantes assured him that it was all uncommon refinement and
      sensibility, which was their sweetest Maria's only fault. Excellent
      claret, and a moderately good opinion of himself, persuaded the marquis of
      the truth of all which the Miss Falconers pleased to say, and her uncle
      graciously granted the delays, which the young lady prayed for week after
      week&mdash;till, at last, striking his hand upon the table, Lord
      Oldborough said, "There must be an end of this&mdash;the papers must be
      signed this day se'nnight&mdash;Maria Hauton shall be married this day
      fortnight."&mdash;Maria Hauton was sent for to her uncle's study; heard
      her doom in sullen silence; but she made no show of resistance, and Lord
      Oldborough was satisfied. An hour afterwards Commissioner Falconer begged
      admission, and presented himself with a face of consternation&mdash;Lord
      Oldborough, not easily surprised or alarmed, waited, however, with some
      anxiety, till he should speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, I beg pardon for this intrusion: I know, at this time, you are
      much occupied; but it is absolutely necessary I should communicate&mdash;I
      feel it to be my duty immediately&mdash;and I cannot hesitate&mdash;though
      I really do not know how to bring myself&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the apparent embarrassment and distress of Mr.
      Falconer, which Lord Oldborough's penetrating eye instantly discerned to
      be affected.&mdash;His lordship turned a chair towards him, but said not a
      word.&mdash;The commissioner sat down like a man acting despair; but
      looking for a moment in Lord Oldborough's face, he saw what his lordship
      was thinking of, and immediately his affected embarrassment became real
      and great.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, commissioner, what is the difficulty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, I have within this quarter of an hour heard what will ruin me
      for ever in your lordship's opinion, unless your lordship does me the
      justice to believe that I never heard or suspected it before&mdash;I have
      only to trust to your magnanimity&mdash;and I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough bowed slightly&mdash;"The fact, if you please, my dear
      sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact, my lord, is, that Captain Bellamy, whose eyes, I suppose, have
      been quickened by jealousy, has discovered what has escaped us all&mdash;what
      never would have occurred to me&mdash;what never could have entered into
      my mind to suspect&mdash;what I still hope&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact, sir, let me beg."
    </p>
    <p>
      The urgency of Lord Oldborough's look and voice admitted of no delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Hauton is in love with my son John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This "Indeed!" was pronounced in a tone which left the commissioner in
      doubt what it expressed, whether pure surprise, indignation, or contempt&mdash;most
      of the last, perhaps: he longed to hear it repeated, but he had not that
      satisfaction. Lord Oldborough turned abruptly&mdash;walked up and down the
      room with such a firm tread as sounded ominously to the commissioner's
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So then, sir, Miss Hauton, I think you tell me, is in love with Cornet
      Falconer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain Bellamy says so, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I care not what Captain Bellamy says&mdash;nor do I well know who or
      what he is&mdash;much less what he can have to do with my family affairs&mdash;I
      ask, sir, what reason you have to believe that my niece is in love, as it
      is called, with your son? You certainly would not make such a report to me
      without good reason for believing it&mdash;what are your reasons?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, my lord, my reasons are founded on information which I do not
      think myself at liberty to repeat: but upon hearing the report from&mdash;"
      The commissioner, in the hurry and confusion of his mind, and in his new
      situation, totally lost his <i>tact</i>, and at this moment was upon the
      point of again saying <i>from Captain Bellamy</i>; but the flash of Lord
      Oldborough's eye warned him of his danger&mdash;he dropped the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I immediately went to sound my son John, and, as far as I can judge, he
      has not yet any suspicion of the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough's countenance cleared. The commissioner recovered his
      presence of mind, for he thought he saw his way before him. "I thought it
      my duty to let your lordship know the first hint I had of such a nature;
      for how soon it might be surmised, or what steps might be taken, I must
      leave it to your lordship to judge&mdash;I can only assure you, that as
      yet, to the best of my belief, John has not any suspicion: fortunately, he
      is very slow&mdash;and not very bright."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough stood with compressed lips, seeming to listen, but deep in
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Commissioner Falconer, let us understand one another well now&mdash;as
      we have done hitherto. If your son, Cornet Falconer, were to marry Maria
      Hauton, she would no longer be my niece, he would have a portionless,
      friendless, and, in my opinion, a very silly wife. He is, I think you say,
      not very bright himself&mdash;he would probably remain a cornet the rest
      of his days&mdash;all idea of assistance being of course out of the
      question in that case, from me or mine, to him or his."
    </p>
    <p>
      The awful pause which Lord Oldborough made, and his determined look, gave
      the commissioner opportunity to reflect much in a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary," resumed his lordship, "if your son John, my dear sir,
      show the same desire to comply with my wishes, and to serve my interests,
      which I have found in the rest of his family, he shall find me willing and
      able to advance him as well as his brother Cunningham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your lordship's wishes will, I can answer for it, be laws to him, as well
      as to the rest of his family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In one word then&mdash;let Cornet Falconer be married elsewhere, within a
      fortnight, and I prophesy that within a year he shall be a field-officer&mdash;within
      two years, a lieutenant-colonel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Commissioner Falconer bowed twice&mdash;low to the field-officer&mdash;lower
      to the lieutenant-colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have long had a match in my eye for John," said the father; "but a
      fortnight, my gracious lord&mdash;that is so very short a time! Your
      lordship will consider there are delicacies in these cases&mdash;no young
      lady&mdash;it is impossible&mdash;your lordship must be sensible that it
      is really impossible, with a young lady of any family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am aware that it is difficult, but not impossible," replied Lord
      Oldborough, rising deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner took his leave, stammering somewhat of "nothing being
      impossible for a friend," courtier, he should have said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner set to work in earnest about the match he had in view for
      John. Not one, but several fair visions flitted before the eye of his
      politic mind. The Miss Chattertons&mdash;any one of whom would, he knew,
      come readily within the terms prescribed, but then they had neither
      fortune nor connexions. A relation of Lady Jane Granville's&mdash;excellent
      connexion, and reasonable fortune; but there all the decorum of regular
      approaches and time would be necessary: luckily, a certain Miss Petcalf
      was just arrived from India with a large fortune. The general, her father,
      was anxious to introduce his daughter to the fashionable world, and to
      marry her for connexion&mdash;fortune no object to him&mdash;delicacies he
      would waive. The commissioner saw&mdash;counted&mdash;and decided&mdash;(there
      was a brother Petcalf, too, who might do for Georgiana&mdash;but for that
      no hurry)&mdash;John was asked by his father if he would like to be a
      major in a year, and a lieutenant-colonel in two years?
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure he would&mdash;was he a fool?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he must be married in a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      John did not see how this conclusion followed immediately from the
      premises, for John was not <i>quite</i> a fool; so he answered "Indeed!"
      An <i>indeed</i> so unlike Lord Oldborough's, that the commissioner,
      struck with the contrast, could scarcely maintain the gravity the occasion
      required, and he could only pronounce the words, "General Petcalf has a
      daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, Miss Petcalf&mdash;ay, he is a general; true&mdash;now I see it all:
      well, I'm their man&mdash;I have no objection&mdash;But Miss Petcalf!&mdash;is
      not that the Indian girl? Is not there a drop of black blood?&mdash;No,
      no, father," cried John, drawing himself up, "I'll be d&mdash;d...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear me first, my own John," cried his father, much and justly alarmed,
      for this motion was the precursor of an obstinate fit, which, if John
      took, perish father, mother, the whole human race, he could not be moved
      from the settled purpose of his soul. "Hear me, my beloved John&mdash;for
      you are a man of sense," said his unblushing father: "do you think I'd
      have a drop of black blood for my daughter-in-law, much less let my
      favourite son&mdash;But there's none&mdash;it is climate&mdash;all climate&mdash;as
      you may see by only looking at Mrs. Governor Carneguy, how she figures
      every where; and Miss Petcalf is nothing near so dark as Mrs. Carneguy,
      surely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And her father, the general, gives her an Indian fortune to suit an
      Indian complexion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good, at any rate," quoth John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear major&mdash;yes, my lieutenant-colonel&mdash;to be sure
      that's good. So to secure the good the gods provide us, go you this
      minute, dress, and away to your fair Indian! I'll undertake the business
      with the general."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But a fortnight, my dear father," said John, looking into the glass: "how
      can that be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look again, and tell me how it can <i>not</i> be? Pray don't put that
      difficulty into Miss Petcalf's head&mdash;into her heart I am sure it
      would never come."
    </p>
    <p>
      John yielded his shoulder to the push his father gave him towards the
      door, but suddenly turning back, "Zounds! father, a fortnight!" he
      exclaimed: "why there won't be time to buy even boots!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what are even boots," replied his father, "to such a man as you? Go,
      go, man; your legs are better than all the boots in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      Flattery can find her way to soothe the dullest, coldest ear <i>alive</i>.
      John looked in the glass again&mdash;dressed&mdash;and went to flatter
      Miss Petcalf. The proposal was graciously accepted, for the commissioner
      stated, as he was permitted in confidence to the general, that his son was
      under the special patronage of Lord Oldborough, who would make him a
      lieutenant-colonel in two years. The general, who looked only for
      connexion and genteel family, was satisfied. The young lady started at the
      first mention of an <i>early day</i>; but there was an absolute necessity
      for pressing that point, since the young officer was ordered to go abroad
      in a fortnight, and could not bear to leave England without completing his
      union with Miss Petcalf. These reasons, as no other were to be had, proved
      sufficient with father and daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      John was presented with a captain's commission. He, before the end of the
      fortnight, looked again and again in the glass to take leave of himself,
      hung up his flute, and&mdash;was married. The bride and bridegroom were
      presented to Lord and Lady Oldborough, and went immediately abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the forms of homage and the rights of vassalage are altered; the
      competition for favour having succeeded to the dependence for protection,
      the feudal lord of ancient times could ill compete in power with the
      influence of the modern political patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pending the negotiation of this marriage, and during the whole of this
      eventful fortnight, Cunningham Falconer had been in the utmost anxiety
      that can be conceived&mdash;not for a brother's interests, but for his
      own: his own advancement he judged would depend upon the result, and he
      could not rest day or night till the marriage was happily completed&mdash;though,
      at the same time, he secretly cursed all the loves and marriages, which
      had drawn Lord Oldborough's attention away from that embassy on which his
      own heart was fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst, the while, though not admitted behind the scenes, said he was
      sufficiently amused by what he saw on the stage, enjoyed the comedy of the
      whole, and pretty well made out for himself the double plot. The
      confidante, Miss Falconer, played her part to admiration, and prevailed on
      Miss Hauton to appear on the appointed day in the character of a <i>reasonable
      woman</i>; and accordingly she suffered herself to be led, in fashionable
      style, to the hymeneal altar by the Marquis of Twickenham. This dénouement
      satisfied Lord Oldborough.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day after his niece's marriage was happily effected, Lord Oldborough
      said to his secretary, "Now, Mr. Cunningham Falconer, I have leisure to
      turn my mind again to the Tourville papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was in hopes, my lord," said the secretary (<i>se composant le visage</i>),
      "I was in hopes that this happy alliance, which secures the Duke of
      Greenwich, would have put your lordship's mind completely at ease, and
      that you would not have felt it necessary to examine farther into that
      mystery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weak men never foresee adversity during prosperity, nor prosperity during
      adversity," replied Lord Oldborough. "His majesty has decided immediately
      to recall his present envoy at that German court; a new one will be sent,
      and the choice of that envoy his majesty is graciously pleased to leave to
      me.&mdash;You are a very young man, Mr. Cunningham Falconer, but you have
      given me such <i>written</i> irrefragable proofs of your ability and
      information, that I have no scruple in recommending you to his majesty as
      a person to whom his interests may be intrusted, and the zeal and
      attachment your family have shown me in actions, not in words only, have
      convinced me that I cannot choose better for my private affairs.
      Therefore, if the appointment be agreeable to you, you cannot too soon
      make what preparations may be necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham, delighted, made his acknowledgments and thanks for the honour
      and the favour conferred upon him with all the eloquence in his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I endeavour not to do any thing hastily, Mr. Cunningham Falconer," said
      his lordship. "I frankly tell you, that I was not at first prepossessed in
      your favour, nor did I feel inclined to do more for you than that to which
      I had been induced by peculiar circumstances. Under this prepossession, I
      perhaps did not for some time do justice to your talents; but I should be
      without judgment or without candour, if I did not feel and acknowledge the
      merit of the performance which I hold in my hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      The performance was a pamphlet in support of Lord Oldborough's
      administration, published in Cunningham's name, but the greater part of it
      was written by his good genius in the garret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On <i>this</i>," said Lord Oldborough, putting his hand upon it as it lay
      on the table, "on <i>this</i> found your just title, sir, to my esteem and
      confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Would not the truth have burst from any man of common generosity, honour,
      or honesty?&mdash;Would not a man who had any feeling, conscience, or
      shame, supposing he could have resolved to keep his secret, at this
      instant, have been ready to sink into the earth with confusion, under this
      unmerited praise?&mdash;In availing himself falsely of a title to esteem
      and confidence, then fraudulently of another's talents to obtain favour,
      honour, and emolument, would not a blush, or silence, some awkwardness, or
      some hesitation, have betrayed him to eyes far less penetrating than those
      of Lord Oldborough? Yet nothing of this was felt by Cunningham: he made,
      with a good grace, all the disqualifying speeches of a modest author,
      repeated his thanks and assurances of grateful attachment, and retired
      triumphant.&mdash;It must be acknowledged that he was fit for a
      diplomatist. His credentials were forthwith made out in form, and his
      instructions, public and private, furnished. No expense was spared in
      fitting him out for his embassy&mdash;his preparations made, his suite
      appointed, his liveries finished, his carriage at the door, he departed in
      grand style; and all Commissioner Falconer's friends, of which, at this
      time, he could not fail to have many, poured in with congratulations on
      the rapid advancement of his sons, and on all sides exclamations were
      heard in favour of <i>friends in power</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True&mdash;very true, indeed. And see what it is," said Commissioner
      Falconer, turning to Buckhurst, "see what it is to have a son so perverse,
      that he will not make use of a good friend when he has one, and who will
      not accept the promise of an excellent living when he can get it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All his friends and acquaintance now joining in one chorus told Buckhurst,
      in courtly terms, that he was a fool, and Buckhurst began to think they
      must be right.&mdash;"For here," said he to himself, "are my two precious
      brothers finely provided for, one an envoy, the other a major <i>in esse</i>,
      and a lieutenant-colonel <i>in posse</i>&mdash;and I, <i>in esse</i> and
      <i>in posse</i>, what?&mdash;Nothing but a good fellow&mdash;one day with
      the four in hand club, the next in my chambers, studying the law, by which
      I shall never make a penny. And there's Miss Caroline Percy, who has
      declined the honour of my hand, no doubt, merely because I have indulged a
      little in good company, instead of immuring myself with Coke and
      Blackstone, Viner and Saunders, Bosanquet and Puller, or chaining myself
      to a special-pleader's desk, like cousin Alfred, that galley-slave of the
      law!&mdash;No, no, I'll not make a galley-slave of myself. Besides, at my
      mother's, in all that set, and in the higher circles with Hauton and the
      Clays, and those people, whenever I appear in the character of a poor
      barrister, I am scouted&mdash;should never have <i>got on</i> at all, but
      for my being a wit&mdash;a wit!&mdash;and have not I wit enough to make my
      fortune? As my father says, What hinders me?&mdash;My conscience only. And
      why should my conscience be so cursedly delicate, so unlike other men's
      consciences?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In this humour, Buckhurst was easily persuaded by his father to take
      orders. The paralytic incumbent of Chipping-Friars had just at this time
      another stroke of the palsy, on which Colonel Hauton congratulated the
      young deacon; and, to keep him in patience while waiting for the third
      stroke, made him chaplain to his regiment.&mdash;The Clays also introduced
      him to their uncle, Bishop Clay, who had, as they told him, taken a
      prodigious fancy to him; for he observed, that in carving a partridge,
      Buckhurst never touched the wing with a knife, but after nicking the
      joint, tore it off, so as to leave adhering to the bone that muscle
      obnoxious to all good eaters.&mdash;The bishop pronounced him to be "a
      capital carver."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune at this time threw into Buckhurst's hands unasked, unlooked-for,
      and in the oddest way imaginable, a gift of no small value in itself, and
      an earnest of her future favours. At some high festival, Buckhurst was
      invited to dine with the bishop. Now Bishop Clay was a rubicund,
      full-blown, short-necked prelate, with the fear of apoplexy continually
      before him, except when dinner was on the table; and at this time a dinner
      was on the table, rich with every dainty of the season, that earth, air,
      and sea, could provide. Grace being first said by the chaplain, the bishop
      sat down "<i>richly to enjoy</i>;" but it happened in the first onset,
      that a morsel too large for his lordship's swallow stuck in his throat.
      The bishop grew crimson&mdash;purple&mdash;black in the face; the chaplain
      started up, and untied his neckcloth. The guests crowded round, one
      offering water, another advising bread, another calling for a raw egg,
      another thumping his lordship on the back. Buckhurst Falconer, with more
      presence of mind than was shown by any other person, saved his patron's
      life. He blew with force in the bishop's ear, and thus produced such a
      salutary convulsion in the throat, as relieved his lordship from the
      danger of suffocation [Footnote: Some learned persons assert that this
      could not have happened. We can only aver that it did happen. The
      assertions against the possibility of the fact remind us of the physician
      in Zadig, who, as the fable tells us, wrote a book to prove that Zadig
      should have gone blind, though he had actually recovered the use of his
      eye.&mdash;Zadig never read the book.]. The bishop, recovering his breath
      and vital functions, sat up, restored to life and dinner&mdash;he ate
      again, and drank to Mr. Buckhurst Falconer's health, with thanks for this
      good service to the church, to which he prophesied the reverend young
      gentleman would, in good time, prove an honour. And that he might be, in
      some measure, the means of accomplishing his own prophecy, Bishop Clay
      did, before he slept, which was immediately after dinner, present Mr.
      Buckhurst Falconer with a living worth 400<i>l.</i> a year; a living which
      had not fallen into the bishop's gift above half a day, and which, as
      there were six worthy clergymen in waiting for it, would necessarily have
      been disposed of the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! star of patronage, shine ever thus upon the Falconers!" cried
      Buckhurst, when, elevated with wine in honour of the church, he gave an
      account to his father at night of the success of the day.&mdash;"Oh! thou,
      whose influence has, for us, arrested Fortune at the top of her wheel, be
      ever thus propitious!&mdash;Only make me a dean. Have you not made my
      brother, the dunce, a colonel? and my brother, the knave, an envoy?&mdash;I
      only pray to be a dean&mdash;I ask not yet to be a bishop&mdash;you see I
      have some conscience left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said his father, laughing. "Now go to bed, Buckhurst; you may, for
      your fortune is up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! my good cousin Percys, where are you now?&mdash;Education, merit,
      male and female, where are you now?&mdash;Planting cabbages, and presiding
      at a day-school: one son plodding in a pleader's office&mdash;another cast
      in an election for an hospital physician&mdash;a third encountering a
      plague in the West Indies. I give you joy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder the commissioner exulted, for he had not only provided thus
      rapidly for his sons, but he had besides happy expectations for himself.&mdash;With
      Lord Oldborough he was now in higher favour and confidence than he had
      ever hoped to be. Lord Oldborough, who was a man little prone to promise,
      and who always did more than he said, had, since the marriage of his
      niece, thrown out a hint that he was aware of the expense it must have
      been to Commissioner and Mrs. Falconer to give entertainments continually,
      and to keep open house, as they had done this winter, for his political
      friends&mdash;no instance of zeal in his majesty's service, his lordship
      said, he hoped was ever lost upon him, and, if he continued in power, he
      trusted he should find occasion to show his gratitude. This from another
      minister might mean nothing but to pay with words; from Lord Oldborough
      the commissioner justly deemed it as good as a promissory note for a
      lucrative place. Accordingly he put it in circulation directly among his
      creditors, and he no longer trembled at the expense at which he had lived
      and was living. Both Mrs. Falconer and he had ever considered a good cook,
      and an agreeable house, as indispensably necessary to those who would rise
      in the world; and they laid it down as a maxim, that, if people wished to
      grow rich, they must begin by appearing so. Upon this plan every thing in
      their establishment, table, servants, equipage, dress, were far more
      splendid than their fortune could afford. The immediate gratification
      which resulted from this display, combining with their maxims of policy,
      encouraged the whole family to continue this desperate game. Whenever the
      timidity of the commissioner had started; when, pressed by his creditors,
      he had backed, and had wished to stop in this course of extravagance; his
      lady, of a more intrepid character, urged him forward, pleading that he
      had gone too far to recede&mdash;that the poorer they were, the more
      necessary to keep up the brilliant appearance of affluence. How else could
      her daughters, after all the sums that had been risked upon them, hope to
      be advantageously established? How otherwise could they preserve what her
      friend Lady Jane Granville so justly styled the patronage of fashion?
    </p>
    <p>
      When success proved Mrs. Falconer to be right, "Now, Commissioner
      Falconer! Now!" How she triumphed, and how she talked! Her sons all in
      such favour&mdash;her daughters in such fashion! No party without the Miss
      Falconers!&mdash;Miss Falconers must sing&mdash;Miss Falconers must play&mdash;Miss
      Falconers must dance, or no lady of a house could feel herself happy, or
      could think she had done her duty&mdash;no piano, no harp could draw such
      crowds as the Miss Falconers. It was the ambition among the fashionable
      men to dance with the Miss Falconers, to flirt with the Miss Falconers.
      "Not merely flirting, ma'am," as Mrs. Falconer said, and took proper pains
      should be heard, "but several serious proposals from very respectable
      quarters:" however, none <i>yet</i> exactly what she could resolve to
      accept for the girls&mdash;she looked high for them, she owned&mdash;she
      thought she had a right to look high. Girls in fashion should not take the
      first offers&mdash;they should hold up their heads: why should they not
      aspire to rank, why not to title, as well as to fortune?
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Petcalf! General Petcalf's son had been for some time, as it was well
      known, desperately in love with Miss Georgiana Falconer; but what chance
      had he now? However, he was to be <i>managed</i>: he was useful sometimes,
      as a partner, "to whom one may say one is engaged when a person one does
      not choose to dance with asks for the honour of one's hand&mdash;useful
      sometimes to turn over the leaves of the music-book&mdash;useful always as
      an attendant in public places&mdash;useful, in short, to be exhibited as a
      captive; for one captive leads to another conquest." And Miss Arabella
      Falconer, too, could boast her conquests, though nobody merely by looking
      at her would have guessed it: but she was a striking exemplification of
      the truth of Lady Jane Granville's maxim, that fashion, like Venus's
      girdle, can beautify any girl, let her be ever so ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the Falconer family having risen and succeeded beyond their most
      sanguine hopes by a combination of lucky circumstances, and by adherence
      to their favourite system, we leave them fortified in their principles,
      and at the height of prosperity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fortune, as if she had been piqued by Mr. Percy's disdain, and jealous of
      his professed reliance upon the superior power of her rival, Prudence,
      seemed now determined to humble him and all his family, to try if she
      could not force him to make some of the customary sacrifices of principle
      to propitiate her favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unsuspicious of the designs that were carrying forward against him in
      secret, Mr. Percy had quite forgotten his fears that his wicked relation
      Sir Robert Percy, and Solicitor Sharpe, might take advantage of the loss
      of that deed which had never been found since the night of the fire at
      Percy-hall. It was nearly two years afterwards that Mr. Percy received a
      letter from his cousin, Sir Robert, informing him that he had been advised
      to dispute the title to the Percy estate, that he had the opinion of the
      first lawyers in England in his favour, and that he had given directions
      to his solicitor, Mr. Sharpe, to commence a suit to reinstate the lawful
      heir in the property of his ancestors.&mdash;Sir Robert Percy added
      something about his reluctance to go to law, and a vast deal about
      candour, justice, and family friendship, which it would be needless and
      unreasonable to repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresh search was now made for the lost deed, but in vain; and in vain
      Rosamond reproached herself with having betrayed the secret of that loss
      to the revengeful attorney.&mdash;The ensuing post brought notice from Mr.
      Sharpe that proceedings were commenced.&mdash;In Sir Robert's letter,
      though not in the attorney's, there was obviously left an opening for an
      offer to compromise; this was done either with intent to lure Mr. Percy on
      to make an offer, which might afterwards appear against him, or it was
      done in the hope that, intimidated by the fear of an expensive and
      hazardous suit, Mr. Percy might give up half his estate, to secure the
      quiet possession of the remainder. But they knew little of Mr. Percy who
      argued in this manner: he was neither to be lured nor intimidated from his
      right&mdash;all compromise, "all terms of commerce he disdained." He sent
      no answer, but prepared to make a vigorous defence. For this purpose he
      wrote to his son Alfred, desiring him to spare no pains or expense, to
      engage the best counsel, and to put them in full possession of the cause.
      Alfred regretted that he was not of sufficient standing at the bar to take
      the lead in conducting his father's cause: he, however, prepared all the
      documents with great care and ability. From time to time, as the business
      went on, he wrote to his father in good spirits, saying that he had
      excellent hopes they should succeed, notwithstanding the unfortunate loss
      of the deed; that the more he considered the case, the more clearly the
      justice of their cause and the solidity of their right appeared. Alas!
      Alfred showed himself to be but a young lawyer, in depending so much upon
      right and justice, while a point of law was against him. It is
      unnecessary, and would be equally tedious and unintelligible to most
      readers, to dwell upon the details of this suit. Contrary to the usual
      complaints of the law's delay, this cause went through the courts in a
      short time, because Mr. Percy did not make use of any subterfuge to
      protract the business. A decree was given in favour of Sir Robert Percy,
      and he became the legal possessor of the great Percy estate in Hampshire,
      which had been so long the object of his machinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, at one stroke, the Percy family fell from the station and affluence
      which they had so long, and, in the opinion of all who knew them, so well
      enjoyed. Great was the regret among the higher classes, and great, indeed,
      the lamentations of the poor in the neighbourhood, when the decree was
      made known. It seemed as if the change in their situation was deplored as
      a general misfortune, and as if it were felt by all more than by the
      sufferers themselves, who were never seen to give way to weak complaints,
      or heard to utter an invective against their adversary. This magnanimity
      increased the public sympathy, and pity for them was soon converted into
      indignation against Sir Robert Percy. Naturally insolent, and now elated
      with success, he wrote post after post to express his impatience to come
      and take possession of his estate, and to hasten the departure of his
      relations from the family seat. This was as cruel as it was unnecessary,
      for from the moment when they learnt the event of the trial, they had been
      occupied with the preparations for their departure; for the resignation of
      all the conveniences and luxuries they possessed, all the pleasures
      associated with the idea of home; for parting with all the animate and
      inanimate objects to which they had long and early habits of affection and
      attachment. This family had never been proud in prosperity, nor were they
      abject in adversity: they submitted with fortitude to their fate; yet they
      could not, without regret, leave the place where they had spent so many
      happy years.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been settled that the improvements which Mr. Percy had made on the
      estate, the expense of the buildings and furniture at Percy-hall, of which
      a valuation had been made, should be taken in lieu of all arrears of rent
      to which Sir Robert might lay claim. In consequence of this award, Mr.
      Percy and his family were anxious to leave every thing about the house and
      place in perfect order, that they might fulfil punctually their part of
      the agreement. The evening before they were to quit Percy-hall, they went
      into every room, to take a review of the whole. The house was peculiarly
      convenient and well arranged. Mr. Percy had spared nothing to render it in
      every respect agreeable, not only to his guests, but to his family, to
      make his children happy in their home. His daughters' apartments he had
      fitted up for them in the neatest manner, and they had taken pleasure in
      ornamenting them with their own work and drawings. They felt very
      melancholy the evening they were to take leave of these for ever. They
      took down some of their drawings, and all the little trophies preserved
      from childhood, memorials of early ingenuity or taste, which could be of
      no use or value to any one except to themselves; every thing else they
      agreed to leave as usual, to show how kind their father had been to them&mdash;a
      sentiment well suited to their good and innocent minds. They opened their
      writing-tables and their drawing-boxes for the last time; for the last
      time they put fresh flowers into their flower-pots, and, with a sigh, left
      their little apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the family then went out to walk in the park and through the
      shrubberies. It was a delightful summer's evening; the birds were singing&mdash;"Caring
      little," as Rosamond said, "for our going away." The sun was just setting,
      and they thought they had never seen the place look so beautiful. Indeed
      Mr. and Mrs. Percy had, for many years, delighted in cultivating the
      natural beauties of this picturesque situation, and their improvements
      were now beginning to appear to advantage. But they were never to enjoy
      the success of their labours! The old steward followed the family in this
      walk. He stopped every now and then to deplore over each fine tree or
      shrub as they passed, and could scarcely refrain from bursting into
      invectives against <i>him</i> that was coming after them into possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole country cries shame upon the villain," John began; but Mr.
      Percy, with a smile, stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us bear our misfortunes, John, with a good grace; let us be thankful
      for the happiness which we have enjoyed, and submit ourselves to the will
      of Providence. Without any hypocrisy or affected resignation, I say, at
      this instant, what with my whole heart I feel, that I submit, without
      repining, to the will of God, and firmly believe that all is for the
      best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so I strive to do," said John. "But only, I say, if it had pleased
      God to order it otherwise, it's a pity the wicked should come <i>just</i>
      after us to enjoy themselves, when they have robbed us of all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not of all," said Mr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it they have not robbed us of?" cried John: "not a thing but they
      must have from us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; the best of all things we keep for ourselves&mdash;it cannot be taken
      from us&mdash;a good conscience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worth all the rest&mdash;that's true," said John; "and that is what he
      will never have who is coming here to-morrow&mdash;never&mdash;never! They
      say he don't sleep at nights. But I'll say no more about him, only&mdash;he's
      not a good man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure, John, you are not a good courtier," said Mrs. Percy, smiling:
      "you ought to prepare to pay your court to your new master."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>My</i> new master!" cried John, growing red: "the longest day ever I
      live, I'll never have a new master! All that I have in the world came from
      you, and I'll never have another master. Sure you will let me follow you?
      I will be no trouble: though but little, may be I can do something still.
      Surely, madam&mdash;surely, sir&mdash;young ladies, you'll speak for me&mdash;I
      shall be let to follow the fortunes of the family, and go along with you
      into <i>banishment</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good John," said Mr. Percy, "since you desire to follow us into <i>banishment</i>,
      as you call it, you shall; and as long as we have any thing upon earth,
      you shall never want. You must stay here to-morrow, after we are gone, to
      give up possession." (John could not stand this, but turned away to hide
      his face.) "When your business is done," continued Mr. Percy, "you may set
      out and follow us as soon as you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, sir, kindly," said John, with a most grateful bow, that took
      in all the family, "that's new life to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He said not a word more during the rest of the walk, except just as he
      passed near the beach where the ship was wrecked, he exclaimed, "There was
      the first beginning of all our misfortune: who would have thought that
      when we gave them shelter we should be turned out so soon ourselves? 'twas
      that drunken rascal of a Dutch carpenter was the cause of all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the whole family set out in an open carriage, which had
      been made for the purpose of carrying as many of the young people as
      possible upon excursions of pleasure. It was a large sociable, which they
      used to call their <i>caravan</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the great gate of the park old John stopped the carriage, and leaning
      over to his master, whispered, "I beg your pardon, sir, but God bless you,
      and don't drive through the village: if you please, take the back road;
      for I've just learned that <i>he</i> is on the great road, and as near
      hand as the turn at the school-house, and they say he wants to be driving
      in his coach and four through the village as you are all going out&mdash;now
      I wouldn't for any thing he had that triumph over us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, good John," said Mr. Percy, "but such triumphs cannot mortify
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor John reluctantly opened the gate and let the carriage pass&mdash;they
      drove on&mdash;they cast a lingering look behind as they quitted the park&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &mdash;"Must I then leave thee, Paradise?"&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      As they passed through the village the poor people came out of their
      houses to take leave of their excellent landlord; they flocked round the
      carriage, and hung upon it till it stopped, and then, with one voice, they
      poured forth praises, and blessings, and prayers for better days. Just at
      this moment Sir Robert Percy made his appearance. His equipage was
      splendid; his coachman drove his four fine horses down the street, the
      middle of which was cleared in an instant. The crowd gazed at the show as
      it passed&mdash;Sir Robert gave a signal to his coachman to drive slower,
      that he might longer enjoy the triumph&mdash;he put his head out of the
      coach window, but no one cried, "God bless him!" His insolence was
      obviously mortified as he passed the Percy family, for Mr. Percy bowed
      with an air of dignity and cheerfulness which seemed to say, "My fortune
      is yours&mdash;but I am still myself." Some of the spectators clapped
      their hands, and some wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy seemed to have prepared his mind for every circumstance of his
      departure, and to be perfectly composed, or at least master of his
      feelings; but a small incident, which had not been foreseen, suddenly
      moved him almost to tears: as they crossed the bridge, which was at the
      farthest end of the village, they heard the muffled bells of the church
      toll as if for a public calamity [Footnote: On Mr. Morris's departure from
      Piercefield the same circumstance happened.]. Instantly recollecting the
      resentment to which these poor people were exposing themselves, by this
      mark of their affection and regret, Mr. Percy went by a short path to the
      church as quickly as possible, and had the bells unmuffled.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy fortunately possessed, independently of the Percy estate, a farm
      worth about seven or eight hundred a year, which he had purchased with
      part of his wife's fortune; on which he had built a lodge, that he had
      intended for the future residence of one of his sons. <i>The Hills</i> was
      the name of this lodge, to which all the family now retired. Though it was
      in the same county with Percy-hall, Clermont-park, Falconer-court,
      Hungerford-castle, and within reach of several other gentlemen's seats,
      yet from its being in a hilly part of the country, through which no
      regular road had been made, it was little frequented, and gave the idea
      not only of complete retirement, but of remoteness. Though a lonely
      situation, it was, however, a beautiful one. The house stood on the brow
      of a hill, and looked into a deep glen, through the steep descent of which
      ran a clear and copious rivulet rolling over a stony bed; the rocks were
      covered with mountain flowers, and wild shrubs&mdash;But nothing is more
      tiresome than a picture in prose: we shall, therefore, beg our readers to
      recall to their imagination some of the views they may have seen in Wales,
      and they will probably have a better idea of this place than any that we
      could give by the most laboured description, amplified with all the
      epithets in the English language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house at the Hills, though finished, was yet but scantily furnished,
      and was so small that it could hardly hold the family, who were now
      obliged to take refuge in it. However, they were well disposed to
      accommodate each other: they had habits of order, and had so little
      accustomed themselves to be waited upon, that this sudden change in their
      fortune and way of life did not appear terrible, as it would to many in
      the same rank. Undoubtedly they felt the loss of real conveniences, but
      they were not tormented with ideal wants, or with the pangs of mortified
      vanity. Evils they had to bear, but they were not the most dreadful of all
      evils&mdash;those of the imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy, to whom his whole family looked for counsel and support, now
      showed all the energy and decision of his character. What he knew must be
      done sooner or later he did decidedly at first. The superfluities to which
      his family had been accustomed, were instantly abandoned. The great
      torment of decayed gentry is the remembrance of their former station, and
      a weak desire still to appear what their fortune no longer allows them to
      be. This folly Mr. Percy had not to combat in his family, where all were
      eager to resign even more of their own comforts than the occasion
      required. It was the object now for the family who were at home to live as
      frugally as possible, that they might save as much of their small income
      as they could, to assist and forward the sons in their professions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eldest son, Godfrey, could not yet have heard of the change in his
      father's fortune, and in his own expectations; but from a passage in his
      last letter, it was evident that he had some idea of the possibility of
      such a reverse, and that he was preparing himself to live with economy.
      From Alfred and Erasmus Mr. Percy had at this trying time the satisfaction
      of receiving at once the kindest and the most manly letters, containing
      strong expressions of gratitude to their father for having given them such
      an education as would enable them, notwithstanding the loss of hereditary
      fortune, to become independent and respectable. What would have been the
      difference of their fate and of their feelings, had they been suffered to
      grow up into mere idle lounging gentlemen, or four-in-hand coachmen! In
      different words, but with the same spirit, both brothers declared that
      this change in the circumstances of their family did not depress their
      minds, but, on the contrary, gave them new and powerful motives for
      exertion. It seemed to be the first wish of their souls to fulfil the fond
      hopes and predictions of their father, and to make some return for the
      care their parents had taken of their education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their father, pleased by the sanguine hopes and ardent spirit expressed in
      their letters, was, however, sensible that a considerable time must elapse
      before they could make any thing by law or medicine. They were as yet only
      in the outset of their professions, the difficult beginning, when men must
      toil often without reward, be subject to crosses and losses, and rebukes
      and rebuffs, when their rivals push them back, and when they want the
      assistance of friends to help them forward, whilst with scarcely the means
      to live they must appear like gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the faithful steward, two servants, who were much attached to the
      family, accompanied them to their retirement. One was Mrs. Harte, who had
      lived with Mrs. Percy above thirty years; and who, from being a
      housekeeper with handsome wages and plenary power over a numerous
      household at Percy-hall, now served with increased zeal at the Hills,
      doing a great part of the work of the house herself, with the assistance
      only of a stout country girl newly hired, whose awkwardness and ignorance,
      or, as Mrs. Harte expressed it, whose <i>comical</i> ways, she bore with a
      patience that cost her more than all the rest. The other servant who
      followed the altered fortunes of the Percy family was a young man of the
      name of Johnson, whom Mr. Percy had bred up from a boy, and who was so
      creditable a servant that he could readily have obtained a place with high
      wages in any opulent family, either in the country or in London; but he
      chose to abide by his master, who could now only afford to give him very
      little. Indeed, Mr. Percy would not have kept any man-servant in his
      present circumstances, but out of regard for this young man, who seemed
      miserable at the thoughts of leaving him, and who undertook to make
      himself useful in the farm as well as in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very different was Johnson from the present race of <i>fine</i> town
      servants, who follow with no unequal steps the follies and vices of their
      <i>betters</i>; and who, by their insolence and extravagance, become the
      just torments of their masters. Very different was Johnson from some
      country servants, who with gross selfishness look solely to their own
      eating and drinking, and whose only thought is how to swallow as much and
      do as little as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had settled his home, Mr. Percy looked abroad to a tract of
      improveable ground, on which he might employ his agricultural skill. He
      had reason to rejoice in having really led the life of a country
      gentleman. He understood country business, and he was ably assisted in all
      the details of farming and management. Never, in the most prosperous days,
      did the old steward seem so fully interested in his master's affairs, so
      punctual and active in executing his commands, and, above all, so
      respectful in his manner to his master, as now in his fallen fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be uninteresting to readers who are not farmers to enter into a
      detail of Mr. Percy's probable improvements. It is enough to say, that his
      hopes were founded upon experience, and that he was a man capable of
      calculating. He had been long in the habit of keeping accurate accounts,
      not such as gentlemen display when they are pleased to prove that their
      farm, produces more than ever farm produced before. All the tradesmen with
      whom he had dealt were, notwithstanding his change of fortune, ready to
      trust him; and those who were strangers, finding themselves regularly
      paid, soon acquired confidence in his punctuality. So that, far from being
      terrified at having so little, he felt surprised at having still so much
      money at his command.&mdash;The enjoyment of high credit must surely give
      more pleasurable feelings than the mere possession of wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, during the first year after he had been deprived of the Percy
      estate, Mr. Percy declared, that, as to himself, he had actually lost
      nothing; for he had never been expensive or luxurious, his personal
      enjoyments were nearly the same, and his active pursuits were not very
      different from what they had always been. He had, it is true, less time
      than he wished to give to literature, or to indulge in the company and
      conversation of his wife and daughters; but even the pain of this
      privation was compensated by the pleasure he felt in observing the
      excellences in their characters which adversity developed.&mdash;It has by
      some persons been thought, that women who have been suffered to acquire
      literary tastes, whose understandings have been cultivated and refined,
      are apt to disdain or to become unfit for the useful minutiæ of domestic
      duties. In the education of her daughters Mrs. Percy had guarded against
      this danger, and she now experienced the happy effects of her prudence. At
      first they had felt it somewhat irksome, in their change of circumstances,
      to be forced to spend a considerable portion of their time in preparations
      for the mere business of living, but they perceived that this constraint
      gave a new spring to their minds, and a higher relish to their favourite
      employments. After the domestic business of the day was done, they
      enjoyed, with fresh delight, the pleasures of which it is not in the power
      of fortune to deprive us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the family were settled at the Hills, they were surprised by a
      visit from Commissioner Falconer&mdash;<i>surprised</i>, because, though
      they knew that he had a certain degree of commonplace friendship for them
      as relations, yet they were aware that his regard was not independent of
      fortune, and they had never supposed that he would come to seek them in
      their retirement. After some general expressions of condolence on their
      losses, their change of situation, and the inconveniences to which a large
      family, bred up, as they had been, in affluence, must suffer in their
      present abode, he went out to walk with Mr. Percy, and he then began to
      talk over his own family affairs. With polite acknowledgment to Mr. Percy
      of the advantage he had derived from his introduction to Lord Oldborough,
      and with modestly implied compliments to his own address in turning that
      introduction to the best possible account, Mr. Falconer led to the subject
      on which he wanted to dilate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, my dear Mr. Percy," said he, "without vanity I may now venture
      to say, my plans for advancing my family have all succeeded; my sons have
      risen in the world, or rather have been pushed up, beyond my most sanguine
      hopes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give you joy with all my heart," said Mr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my good sir, listen to me; your sons might have been in as
      advantageous situations, if you had not been too proud to benefit by the
      evidently favourable dispositions which Lord Oldborough shewed towards you
      and yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too proud! No, my friend, I assure you, pride never influenced my conduct&mdash;I
      acted from principle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you are pleased to call it.&mdash;But we will not go back to the past&mdash;no
      man likes to acknowledge he has been wrong. Let us, if you please, look to
      the future. You know that you are now in a different situation from what
      you were formerly, when you could afford to follow your principles or your
      systems. Now, my dear sir, give me leave to tell you that it is your duty,
      absolutely your duty, to make use of your interest for your sons. There is
      not a man in England, who, if he chose it, might secure for his sons a
      better patron than you could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust," replied Mr. Percy, "that I have secured for my sons what is
      better than a good patron&mdash;a good education."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both are best," said Mr. Falconer. "Proud as you are, cousin Percy, you
      must allow this, when you look round and see who rises, and how.&mdash;And
      now we are by ourselves, let me ask you, frankly and seriously, why do not
      you try to establish your sons by patronage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frankly and seriously, then, because I detest and despise the whole
      system of patronage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's very <i>strong</i>," said Mr. Falconer. "And I am glad for your
      sake, and for the sake of your family, that nobody heard it but myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the whole world heard me," pursued Mr. Percy, "I should say just the
      same. <i>Strong</i>&mdash;very strong!&mdash;I am glad of it; for (excuse
      me, you are my relation, and we are on terms of familiarity) the delicate,
      guarded, qualifying, trimming, mincing, pouncet-box, gentleman-usher mode
      of speaking truth, makes no sort of impression. Truth should always be
      strong&mdash;speaking or acting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, I beg your pardon; as strong let it be as you please, only
      let it be cool, and then we cannot fail to understand one another. I think
      you were going to explain to me why you detest and despise what you call
      the system of patronage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I believe it to be ruinous to my country. Whenever the honours of
      professions, civil, military, or ecclesiastical, are bestowed by favour,
      not earned by merit&mdash;whenever the places of trust and dignity in a
      state are to be gained by intrigue and solicitation&mdash;there is an end
      of generous emulation, and consequently of exertion. Talents and
      integrity, in losing their reward of glory, lose their vigour, and often
      their very existence. If the affairs of this nation were guided, and if
      her battles were fought by the corrupt, imbecile creatures of patronage,
      how would they be guided?&mdash;how fought?&mdash;Woe be to the country
      that trusts to such rulers and such defenders! Woe has been to every
      country that has so trusted!&mdash;May such never be the fate of England!&mdash;And
      that it never may, let every honest independent Englishman set his face,
      his hand, his heart against this base, this ruinous system!&mdash;I will
      for one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For one!&mdash;alas!" said Mr. Falconer, with a sigh meant to be heard,
      and a smile not intended to be seen, "what can one do in such a desperate
      case?&mdash;I am afraid certain things will go on in the world for ever,
      whether we benefit by them or not.&mdash;And if I grant that patronage is
      sometimes a public evil, you must allow that it is often a private
      benefit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt even that," said Mr. Percy; "for those young men who are brought
      up to expect patronage in any profession&mdash;But," said Mr. Percy,
      checking himself, "I forgot whom I am speaking to: I don't wish to say any
      thing that can hurt your feelings, especially when you are so kind to come
      to see me in adversity, and when you show so much interest in my affairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! pray go on, go on," said the commissioner, smiling, "you will not
      hurt me, I assure you: consider I am too firm in the success of my system
      to be easily offended on that point&mdash;go on!&mdash;Those young men who
      are brought up to expect patronage in any profession&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are apt to depend upon it too much," continued Mr. Percy, "and
      consequently neglect to acquire knowledge. They know that things will be
      passed over for them, and they think that they need not be assiduous,
      because they are secure of being provided for, independently of their own
      exertions; and if they have a turn for extravagance, they may indulge it,
      because a place will set all to rights."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if they are provided for, and if they do get good places, are they
      not well enough off?" said Mr. Falconer: "I'll answer for it, your sons
      would think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy, with a look of proud humility, replied, "I am inclined to
      believe that my sons would not think themselves <i>well off</i>, unless
      they were distinguished by their own merit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure," said Mr. Falconer, correcting himself; "of course I mean
      that too: but a young man can never distinguish himself, you know, so well
      as when his merit is raised to a conspicuous situation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or disgrace himself so effectually, as when he is raised to a situation
      for which he is unprepared and unfit."
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner's brow clouded&mdash;some unpleasant reflection or
      apprehension seemed to cross his mind. Mr. Percy had no intention of
      raising any; he meant no allusion to the commissioner's sons&mdash;he
      hastened to turn what he had said more decidedly upon his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have chosen for my sons, or rather they have chosen for themselves,"
      continued he, "professions which are independent of influence, and in
      which it could be of little use to them. Patrons can be of little
      advantage to a lawyer or a physician. No judge, no attorney, can push a
      lawyer up, beyond a certain point&mdash;he may rise like a rocket, but he
      will fall like the stick, if he be not supported by his own inherent
      powers. Where property or life is at stake, men will not compliment or
      even be influenced by great recommendations&mdash;they will consult the
      best lawyer, and the best physician, whoever he may be. I have endeavoured
      to give my Alfred and Erasmus such an education as shall enable them
      honestly to work their own way to eminence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A friend's helping hand is no bad thing," said Mr. Falconer, "in that
      hard and slippery ascent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As many friends, as many helping hands, in a fair way, as you please,"
      said Mr. Percy: "I by no means would inculcate the anti-social, absurd,
      impossible doctrine, that young men, or any men, can or ought to be
      independent of the world. Let my sons make friends for themselves, and
      enjoy the advantage of mine. I object only to their becoming dependent,
      wasting the best years of their lives in a miserable, debasing servitude
      to patrons&mdash;to patrons, who at last may perhaps capriciously desert
      them at their utmost need."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, without designing it, Mr. Percy wakened unpleasant recollections in
      the mind of the commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! there you touch a tender string with me," said Mr. Falconer, sighing.
      "I have known something of that in my life. Lord N&mdash;&mdash; and Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;
      did indeed use me shamefully ill. But I was young then, and did not choose
      my friends well. I know more of the world now, and have done better for my
      sons&mdash;and shall do better, I trust, for myself. In the mean time, my
      dear Mr. Percy, let us think of your affairs. Such a man as you should not
      be lost here on a farm amongst turnips and carrots. So Lord Oldborough
      says and thinks&mdash;and, in short, to come to the point at once, I was
      not sounding you from idle curiosity respecting patronage, or from any
      impertinent desire to interfere with your concerns; but I come,
      commissioned by Lord Oldborough, to make an offer, which, I am persuaded,
      whatever theoretical objections might occur," said the commissioner, with
      a significant smile, "Mr. Percy is too much a man of practical sense to
      reject. Lord Oldborough empowers me to say, that it is his wish to see his
      government supported and strengthened by men of Mr. Percy's talents and
      character; that he is persuaded that Mr. Percy would speak well in
      parliament; that if Mr. Percy will join <i>us</i>, his lordship will bring
      him into parliament, and give him thus an opportunity of at once
      distinguishing himself, advancing his family, repairing the injustice of
      fortune, and serving his country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Commissioner Falconer made this offer with much pomposity, with the air of
      a person sure that he is saying something infinitely flattering, and at
      the same time with a lurking smile on his countenance, at the idea of the
      ease and certainty with which this offer would induce Mr. Percy to recant
      all he had said against patrons and patronage. He was curious to hear how
      the philosopher would change his tone; but, to his surprise, Mr. Percy did
      not alter it in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned his respectful and grateful acknowledgments to Lord
      Oldborough, but begged leave totally to decline the honour intended him;
      he could not, he said, accept it consistently with his principles&mdash;he
      could not go into parliament with a view to advance himself or to provide
      for his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner interrupted to <i>qualify</i>, for he was afraid he had
      spoken too broadly, and observed that what he had said was quite
      confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy understood it so, and assured him there was no danger that it
      should be repeated. The commissioner was then in a state to listen again
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy said, that when he was rich, he had preferred domestic happiness
      to ambition, therefore he had never stood for the county to which he
      belonged; that now he was poor, he felt an additional reason for keeping
      out of parliament, that he might not put himself in a situation to be
      tempted&mdash;a situation where he must spend more than he could afford,
      and could only pay his expenses by selling his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner was silent with astonishment for some moments after Mr.
      Percy ceased speaking. He had always thought his good cousin a singular
      man, but he had never thought him a wrongheaded fool till this moment. At
      first he was somewhat vexed, for Mr. Percy's sake and for the sake of his
      sons, that he refused such an offer; for the commissioner had some of the
      feelings of a relation, but more of the habits of a politician, and these
      last, in a few moments, reconciled him to what he thought the ruin of his
      cousin's prospects in life. Mr. Falconer considered, that if Mr. Percy
      were to go into parliament to join their party, and to get near Lord
      Oldborough, he might become a dangerous rival. He pressed the matter,
      therefore, no longer with urgency, but only just sufficient to enable him
      to report to Lord Oldborough that he had executed his commission, but had
      found Mr. Percy <i>impracticable</i>.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      However sincere the general pity and esteem for the Percy family, they did
      not escape the common lot of mortality; they had their share of blame, as
      well as of condolence, from their friends and acquaintance. Some
      discovered that all the misfortunes of the family might have been avoided,
      if they had listened to good advice; others were quite clear that the
      lawsuit would have been decided in Mr. Percy's favour, if he had employed
      their solicitor or their barrister; or, in short, if every step of the
      suit had been directed differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commissioner Falconer now joined the band of reproaching friends. He did
      not blame Mr. Percy, however, for the conduct of the lawsuit, for of that
      he confessed himself to be no judge, but he thought he understood the
      right way of advancing a family in the world; and on this subject he now
      took a higher tone than he had formerly felt himself entitled to assume.
      Success gives such rights&mdash;especially over the unfortunate. The
      commissioner said loudly in all companies, that he had hoped his relation,
      Mr. Percy, who certainly was a man of talents, and he was convinced
      well-intentioned, would not have shown himself so obstinately attached to
      his peculiar opinions&mdash;especially to his strange notions of
      independence, which must disgust, ultimately, friends whom it was most the
      interest of his family to please; that he doubted not that the young men
      of the Percy family bitterly regretted that their father would not avail
      himself of the advantages of his connexions, of the favourable
      dispositions, and, to his knowledge, most <i>condescending</i> offers that
      had been made to him&mdash;offers which, the commissioner said, he must
      term really condescending, when he considered that Mr. Percy had never
      paid the common court that was expected by a minister. Other
      circumstances, too, enhanced the favour: offence had undoubtedly been
      given by the ill-timed, injudicious interference of Captain Godfrey Percy
      about regimental business&mdash;some Major Gascoigne&mdash;yet,
      notwithstanding this, a certain person, whose steadiness in his
      friendships the commissioner declared he could never sufficiently admire,
      had not, for the son's errors, changed his favourable opinion or
      disposition towards the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Falconer concluded, with a sigh, "There are some men whom the best of
      friends cannot serve&mdash;and such we can only leave to their fate."
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner now considering Mr. Percy as a person so obstinately odd
      that it was unsafe for a rising man to have any thing more to do with him,
      it was agreed in the Falconer family, that it was necessary to let the
      Percys drop&mdash;gently, without making any noise. Mrs. Falconer and her
      daughters having always resided in London during the winter, and at some
      watering place in summer, knew scarcely any thing of the female part of
      the Percy family. Mrs. Falconer had occasionally met Mrs. Percy, but the
      young ladies, who had not yet been in town, she had never seen since they
      were children. Mrs. Falconer now considered this as a peculiarly fortunate
      circumstance, because she should not be blamed for <i>cutting</i> them,
      and should escape all the <i>unpleasantness</i> of breaking off an
      intimacy with relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner acceded to all his lady's observations, and easily shook
      off that attachment, which he had professed for so many years, perhaps
      felt, for his <i>good cousin Percy</i>&mdash;perhaps felt, we say: because
      we really believe that he was attached to Mr. Percy while that gentleman
      was in prosperity. There are persons who have an exclusive sympathy with
      the prosperous.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one, however, who, in this respect, felt differently from the
      rest of the family. Buckhurst Falconer, with a generous impulse of
      affection and gratitude, declared that he would not desert Mr. Percy or
      any of the family in adversity; he could never forget how kind they had
      been to him when he was in distress. Buckhurst's resentment against
      Caroline for her repeated refusals suddenly subsided; his attachment
      revived with redoubled force. He protested that he loved her the better
      for having lost her fortune, and he reiterated this protestation more
      loudly, because his father declared it was absurd and ridiculous. The son
      persisted, till the father, though not subject to make violent
      resolutions, was wrought to such a pitch as to swear, that if Buckhurst
      should be fool enough to think seriously of a girl who was now a beggar,
      he would absolutely refuse his consent to the match, and would never give
      his son a shilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst immediately wrote to Caroline a passionate declaration of the
      constancy and ardour of his attachment, and entreated her permission to
      wait upon her immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not sacrifice me," said Buckhurst, "to idle niceties. That I have many
      faults, I am conscious; but none, I trust, for which you ought utterly to
      condemn me&mdash;none but what you can cure. I am ready to be every thing
      which you approve. Give me but leave to hope. There is no sacrifice I will
      not make to facilitate, to expedite our union. I have been ordained, one
      living I possess, and that which Colonel Hauton has promised me will soon
      come into my possession. Believe me, I was decided to go into the church
      by my attachment&mdash;to my passion for you, every scruple, every
      consideration gave way. As to the rest, I shall never be deterred from
      following the dictates of my heart by the opposition of ambitious parents.
      Caroline, do not sacrifice me to idle niceties&mdash;I know I have the
      misfortune not to please your brother Alfred: to do him justice, he has
      fairly told me that he does not think me worthy of <i>his sister Caroline</i>.
      I forgive him, I admire him for the pride with which he pronounces the
      words, <i>my sister Caroline</i>. But though she may easily find a more
      faultless character, she will never find a warmer heart, or one more truly&mdash;more
      ardently attached."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something frank, warm, and generous in this letter, which
      pleased Rosamond, and which, she said, justified her good opinion of
      Buckhurst. Indeed, the great merit of being ardently attached to her
      sister Caroline was sufficient, in Rosamond's eyes, to cover a multitude
      of sins: and the contrast between his warmth at this moment, and the
      coldness of the rest of his family, struck her forcibly. Rosamond thought
      that Alfred had been too severe in his judgment, and observed, that it was
      in vain to look with a lantern all over the world for a faultless
      character&mdash;a monster. It was quite sufficient if a woman could find
      an honest man&mdash;that She was sure Buckhurst had no faults but what
      love would cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But love has not cured him of any yet," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try marriage," said Rosamond, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline shook her head. "Consider at what expense that trial must be
      made."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first reading of Buckhurst's letter Caroline had been pleased with
      it; but on a second perusal, she was dissatisfied with the passage about
      his parents, nor could she approve of his giving up what he now called his
      <i>scruples</i>, to obtain a competence for the woman he professed to
      adore. She knew that he had been leading a dissipated life in town; that
      he must, therefore, be less fit than he formerly was to make a good
      husband, and still less likely to make a respectable clergyman. He had
      some right feeling, but no steady principle, as Caroline observed. She was
      grateful for the constancy of his attachment, and for the generosity he
      showed in his whole conduct towards her; nor was she insensible to the
      urgency with which Rosamond pleaded in his favour: but she was firm in her
      own judgment; and her refusal, though expressed in the terms that could
      best soften the pain it must give, was as decided as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after her letter had been sent, she and Rosamond had taken a longer
      walk one evening than usual, and, eager in conversation, went on so far in
      this wild unfrequented part of the country, that when they saw the sun
      setting, they began to fear they should not reach home before it was dark.
      They wished to find a shorter way than that by which they went, and they
      looked about in hopes of seeing some labourer (some <i>swinked hedger</i>)
      returning from his work, or a cottage where they could meet with a guide.&mdash;But
      there was no person or house within sight. At last Caroline, who had
      climbed upon a high bank in the lane where they were walking, saw a smoke
      rising between some trees at a little distance; and toward this spot they
      made their way through another lane, the entrance to which had been
      stopped up with furze bushes. They soon came within sight of a
      poor-looking cottage, and saw a young woman walking very slowly with a
      child in her arms. She was going towards the house, and did not perceive
      the young ladies till they were close to her. She turned suddenly when
      they spoke&mdash;started&mdash;looked frightened and confused; the infant
      began to cry, and hushing it as well as she could, she answered to their
      questions with a bewildered look, "I don't know indeed&mdash;I can't tell&mdash;I
      don't know any thing, ladies&mdash;ask at the cottage, yonder." Then she
      quickened her pace, and walked so fast to the house, that they could
      hardly keep up with her. She pushed open the hatch door, and called
      "Dorothy! Dorothy, come out." But no Dorothy answered.&mdash;The young
      woman seemed at a loss what to do; and as she stood hesitating, her face,
      which had at first appeared pale and emaciated, flushed up to her temples.
      She looked very handsome, but in ill-health.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be pleased, ladies," said she, with diffidence, and trembling from head
      to foot, "be pleased to sit down and rest, ladies. One will be in directly
      who knows the ways&mdash;I am a stranger in these parts."
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she had set the chairs, she was retiring to an inner room, but
      her child, who was pleased with Caroline's face as she smiled and nodded
      at him, stretched out his little hands towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! let my sister give him a kiss," said Rosamond. The mother stopped,
      yet appeared unwilling. The child patted Caroline's cheek, played with her
      hair, and laughed aloud. Caroline offered to take the child in her arms,
      but the mother held him fast, and escaped into the inner room, where they
      heard her sobbing violently. Caroline and Rosamond looked at one another
      in silence, and left the cottage by tacit consent, sorry that they had
      given pain, and feeling that they had no right to intrude further. "We can
      go home the same way that we came," said Caroline, "and that is better
      than to trouble any body."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Rosamond: "yet I should like to know something more
      about this poor woman if I could, without&mdash;If we happened to meet
      Dorothy, whoever she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant they saw an old woman come from a copse near the cottage,
      with a bundle of sticks on her back and a tin can in her hand: this was
      Dorothy. She saved them all the trouble and delicacy of asking questions,
      for there was not a more communicative creature breathing. She in the
      first place threw down her faggots, and offered her service to guide the
      young ladies home; she guessed they belonged to the family that was newly
      come to settle at the Hills, which she described, though she could not
      tell the name. She would not be denied the pleasure of showing them the
      shortest and safest way, and the only way by which they could get home
      before it was night-fall. So they accepted her kind offer, and she trudged
      on, talking as she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a weary thing, ladies, to live in this lone place, where one does
      not see a soul to speak to from one month's end to another&mdash;especially
      to me that has lived afore now in my younger days in Lon'on. But it's as
      God pleases! and I wish none had greater troubles in this world than I&mdash;You
      were up at the house, ladies? There within at my little place&mdash;ay&mdash;then
      you saw the greatest and the only great trouble I have, or ever had in
      this life.&mdash;Did not you, ladies, see the young woman with the child
      in her arms?&mdash;But may be you did not mind Kate, and she's nothing now
      to look at, quite faded and gone, though she's only one month past
      nineteen years of age. I am sure I ought to know, for I was at her
      christening, and nursed her mother. She's of very good parentage, that is,
      of a farmer's family, that <i>has</i>, as well as his neighbours, that
      lives a great way off, quite on the other side of the country. And not a
      year, at least not a year and a half ago, I remember Kate Robinson dancing
      on the green at Squire Burton's there with the rest of the girls of the
      village, and without compare the prettiest and freshest, and most
      blithsome and innocent of them all. Ay, she was innocent then, none ever
      more so, and she had no care, but all looking kind upon her in this world,
      and fond parents taking pride in her&mdash;and now look at her what she
      is! Cast off by all, shamed, and forgotten, and broken-hearted, and lost
      as much as if she was in her grave. And better she was in her grave than
      as she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman now really felt so much that she stopped speaking, and she
      was silent for several minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! dear ladies," said she, looking up at Rosamond and Caroline, "I see
      you have kind hearts within you, and I thank you for pitying poor Kate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish we could do any thing to serve her," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! miss, that I am afraid you can't&mdash;that's what I am afraid none
      can now." The good woman paused and looked as if she expected to be
      questioned. Caroline was silent, and the old woman looked disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do not like to question you," said Rosamond, "lest we should ask what
      you might not like to answer, or what the young woman would be sorry that
      you should answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, miss, that's very considerate in you, and only that I know it would
      be for her benefit, I am sure I would not have said a word&mdash;but here
      I have so very little to give her, and that little so coarse fare to what
      she been used to, both when she was at service, and when she was with her
      own people, that I be afraid, weak as she be grown now, she won't do. And
      though I have been a good nurse in my day, I think she wants now a bit
      better doctor than I be&mdash;and then if she could see the minister, to
      take the weight off her heart, to make her not fret so, to bid her look up
      above for comfort, and to raise her with the hope and trust that God will
      have more mercy upon her than her father and mother do have; and to make
      her&mdash;hardest of all!&mdash;forget him that has forsaken her and her
      little one, and been so cruel&mdash;Oh! ladies, to do all that, needs a
      person that can speak to her better and with more authority than I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman stopped again for some minutes, and then recollecting that
      she had not told what she had intended to tell, she said, "I suppose,
      ladies, you guess now how it be, and I ought to beg pardon for speaking of
      such a thing, or such a one, as&mdash;as poor Kate is now, to you, young
      ladies; but though she is fallen so low, and an outcast, she is not
      hardened; and if it had been so that it had pleased Heaven that she had
      been a wife to one in her own condition&mdash;Oh! what a wife, and what a
      mother there was lost in her! The man that wronged her has a deal to
      answer for. But he has no thought of that, nor care for her, or his child;
      but he is a fine man about London, they say, driving about with colonels,
      and lords, and dancing with ladies. Oh! if they saw Kate, one would guess
      they would not think so much of him: but yet, may be, they'd think more&mdash;there's
      no saying how the quality ladies judge on these matters. But this I know,
      that though he was very free of his money, and generous to Kate at the
      first, and even for some months after he quit the country, till I suppose
      he forgot her, yet he has not sent her a guinea for self or child these
      four months, nor a line of a letter of any kind, which she pined for more,
      and we kept thinking the letters she did write did not get to him by the
      post, so we sent one by a grandson of my own, that we knowed would put the
      letter safe into his hands, and did, just as the young gentleman was, as
      my grandson told me, coming out of a fine house in London, and going, with
      a long whip in his hand, to get upon the coach-box of a coach, with four
      horses too&mdash;and he looks at the letter, and puts it in his pocket,
      and calls to my boy, 'No answer now, my good friend&mdash;but I'll write
      by post to her.' Those were the very words; and then that colonel that was
      with him laughing and making game like, went to snatch the letter out of
      the pocket, saying, 'Show us that love-letter, Buckhurst'&mdash;Lord
      forgive me! what have I done now?" said the old woman, stopping short,
      struck by the sudden change in the countenance of both her auditors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Buckhurst Falconer is a relation of ours," said Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear ladies, how could I think you knew him even?" interrupted the old
      woman. "I beg your pardon. Kate says he's not so cruel as he seems, and
      that if he were here this minute, he'd be as kind and generous to her as
      ever.&mdash;It's all forgetfulness just, and giddiness, she says&mdash;or,
      may be, as to the money, that he has it not to spare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To spare!" repeated Caroline, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord love her! what a colour she has now&mdash;and what a spirit spoke
      there! But, ladies, I'd be sorry to hurt the young gentleman; for Kate
      would be angry at me for that worse than at any thing. And as to all that
      has happened, you know it's nothing extraordinary, but what happens every
      day, by all accounts; and young gentlemen, such as he be, thinks nothing
      of it; and the great ladies, I know, by what I noticed when I was in
      sarvice once in Lon'on myself, the great ladies thinks the better of them
      for such things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not a great lady," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I, thank God!" said Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, for certain, if you are not great, you're good ladies," said the
      old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were now within sight of their own house, they thanked and
      dismissed their loquacious but kind-hearted guide, putting into her hand
      some money for poor Kate, Caroline promising to make further inquiries&mdash;Rosamond,
      without restriction, promising all manner of assistance, pecuniary,
      medical, and spiritual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of the inquiries that were made confirmed the truth of all that
      old Dorothy had related, and brought to light other circumstances relative
      to the seduction and desertion of this poor girl, which so shocked
      Rosamond, that in proportion to her former prepossession in Buckhurst's
      favour was now her abhorrence; and as if to repair the imprudence with
      which she had formerly used her influence over her sister's mind in his
      favour, she now went as far on the opposite side, abjuring him with the
      strongest expressions of indignation, and wishing that Caroline's last
      letter had not gone to Buckhurst, that she might have given her refusal on
      this special account, in the most severe and indignant terms the English
      language could supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Percy, however, on the contrary, rejoiced that Caroline's letter had
      been sent before they knew any thing of this affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, ma'am," cried Rosamond, "surely it would have been right for
      Caroline to have given this reason for her refusal, and to have declared
      that this had proved to her beyond a possibility of doubt that her former
      objections to Mr. Buckhurst Falconer's principles were too well founded;
      and it would have become Caroline to have written with strong indignation.
      I am persuaded," continued Rosamond, "that if women would reprobate young
      men for such instances of profligacy and cruelty, instead of suffering
      such conduct to go under the fine plausible general names of gallantry and
      <i>wildness</i>, it would make a greater impression than all the sermons
      that could be preached. And Caroline, who has beauty and eloquence, <i>can</i>
      do this with effect. I remember Godfrey once said, that the peculiar
      characteristic of Caroline, that in which she differed most from the
      common herd of young ladies, is in her power of feeling and expressing
      virtuous indignation. I am sure that Godfrey, partial as he is to Mr.
      Buckhurst Falconer, would think that Caroline ought, on such an occasion,
      to set an example of that proper spirit, which, superior to the fear of
      ridicule and fashion, dares to speak the indignation it feels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well spoken, and better felt, my dear daughter," said Mrs. Percy.
      "And Heaven forbid I should lower the tone of your mind, or your honest
      indignation against vice; but, Rosamond, my dear, let us be just.&mdash;I
      must do even those, whom Godfrey calls the common herd of young ladies,
      the justice to believe that there are many among them who have good
      feeling enough to be angry, very angry, with a lover upon <i>such an
      occasion</i>&mdash;angry enough to write him a most indignant, and,
      perhaps, very eloquent letter.&mdash;You may recollect more than one
      heroine of a novel, who discards her lover upon such a discovery as was
      made by you last night. It is a common novel incident, and, of course,
      from novels every young lady, even, who might not have <i>felt</i> without
      a precedent, knows how she ought to express herself in such circumstances.
      But you will observe, my dear, that both in novels and in real life, young
      ladies generally like and encourage men of feeling in contradistinction to
      men of principle, and too often men of gallantry in preference to men of
      correct morals: in short, that such a character as that of Mr. Buckhurst
      Falconer is just the kind of person with whom many women would fall in
      love. By suffering this to be thought the taste of our sex, ladies
      encourage libertinism in general, more than they can possibly discourage
      it by the loudest display of indignation against particular instances.&mdash;If,
      like your sister Caroline, young ladies would show that they really do not
      prefer such men, it would do essential service. And observe, my dear
      Rosamond, this can be done by every young woman with perfect delicacy: but
      I do not see how she can, with propriety or good effect, do more. It is a
      subject ladies cannot well discuss; a subject upon which the manners and
      customs of the world are so much at variance with religion and morality,
      that entering upon the discussion would lead to greater difficulties than
      you are aware of. It is, therefore, best for our sex to show their
      disapprobation of vice, and to prove their sense of virtue and religion by
      their conduct, rather than to proclaim it to the world in words. Had
      Caroline in her letter expressed her indignation in the most severe terms
      that the English language could supply, she would only have exposed
      herself to the ridicule of Mr. Buckhurst Falconer's fashionable
      companions, as a prating, preaching prude, without doing the least good to
      him, or to any one living."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond reluctantly acknowledged that perhaps her mother was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Caroline, how quietly you sit by, while we are talking of you and
      your lover!" cried Rosamond; "I do not know whether to be provoked with
      you, or to admire you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admire me, pray," said Caroline, "if you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not believe you will ever be in love," said Rosamond. "I confess I
      should admire, or, at least, love you better, if you had more feeling,"
      added Rosamond, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By what do you judge that I want feeling?" said Caroline, colouring
      deeply, and with a look and tone that expressed her keen sense of
      injustice. "What proof have I ever given you of my want of feeling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No proof, that I can recollect," said Rosamond, laughing; "no proof, but
      that you have never been in love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it a proof I am incapable of feeling, that I have not been in love
      with one who has proved himself utterly unworthy of my esteem&mdash;against
      whose conduct my sister cannot find words sufficiently severe to express
      her indignation? Rosamond, my mind inclined towards him at the first
      reading of his last letter; but if I had ever given him any encouragement,
      if I had loved him, what would have been my misery at this moment!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All! my dear, but then if you had been very miserable, I should have
      pitied you so much, and loved you so heartily for being in love," said
      Rosamond, still laughing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Rosamond," continued Caroline, whose mind was now too highly wrought
      for raillery, "is love to be trifled with? No, only by trifling minds or
      by rash characters, by those who do not conceive its power&mdash;its
      danger. Recollect what we have just seen: a young, beautiful woman sinking
      into the grave with shame&mdash;deserted by her parents&mdash;wishing her
      child unborn. Do you remember her look of agony when we praised that
      child? the strongest charm of nature reversed&mdash;the strongest ties
      dissolved; and love brought her to this! She is only a poor servant girl.
      But the highest and the fairest, those of the most cultivated
      understandings, of the tenderest hearts, cannot love bring them down to
      the same level&mdash;to the same fate?&mdash;And not only our weak sex,
      but over the stronger sex, and the strongest of the strong, and the wisest
      of the wise, what is, what has ever been the power, the delusions of that
      passion, which can cast a spell over the greatest hero, throw a blot on
      the brightest glory, blast in a moment a life of fame!&mdash;What must be
      the power of that passion, which can inspire genius in the dullest and the
      coldest, waken heroism in the most timid of creatures, exalt to the
      highest point, or to the lowest degrade our nature&mdash;the bitterest
      curse, or the sweetest blessing Heaven bestows on us in this life!&mdash;Oh!
      sister, is love to be trifled with?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline paused, and Rosamond, for some instants, looked at her and at her
      mother in silence; then exclaimed, "All this from Caroline! Are not you
      astonished, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Mrs. Percy; "I was aware that this was in Caroline's mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not," said Rosamond. "She who never spoke of love!&mdash;I little
      imagined that she thought of it so highly, so seriously."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do think of it seriously, highly may Heaven grant!" cried
      Caroline, looking fervently upwards as she spoke with an illuminated
      countenance. "May Heaven grant that love be a blessing and not a curse to
      me! Heaven grant that I may never, in any moment of selfish vanity, try to
      excite a passion which I cannot return! Heaven grant that I never may feel
      the passion of love but for one whom I shall entirely esteem, who shall be
      worthy to fill my whole soul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," continued Caroline, turning eagerly, and seizing her mother's
      hand, "my guide, my guardian, whenever you see me in any, the slightest
      inclination to coquetry, warn me&mdash;as you wish to save me from that
      which I should most dread, the reproaches of my own conscience&mdash;in
      the first, the very first instance, reprove me, mother, if you can&mdash;with
      severity. And you, my sister, my bosom friend, do not use your influence
      to soften, to open my mind to love; but if ever you perceive me yielding
      my heart to the first tenderness of the passion, watch over me, if the
      object be not every way worthy of me, my equal, my superior.&mdash;Oh! as
      you would wish to snatch me from the grave, rouse me from the delusion&mdash;save
      me from disappointment, regret, remorse, which I know that I could not
      bear, and live."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother, into whose arms she threw herself, pressed Caroline close to
      her heart, while Rosamond, to whom she had given her hand, held it fast,
      and stood motionless between surprise and sympathy. Caroline, to whose
      usual manners and disposition every thing theatrical or romantic was so
      foreign, seemed, as soon as she recollected herself, to be ashamed of the
      excessive emotion and enthusiasm she had shown; withdrawing her hand from
      her sister, she turned away, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother and sister both remained silent for a considerable time, fully
      occupied with their own thoughts and feelings. The mother's reverie looked
      to the future prospects of her daughter;&mdash;confident in Caroline's
      character, yet uncertain of her fate, she felt a pleasing yet painful
      solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond's thoughts turned rather to the past than to the future: she
      recollected and compared words and looks, yet found insuperable difficulty
      in connecting all she had ever before known or fancied of Caroline with
      what she had just seen and heard. Rosamond did not fairly recover from her
      surprise, and from her look of perplexity, during a full hour that she
      remained absolutely silent, poring upon a screen, upon which she saw
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then went in search of Caroline, in hopes of renewing the
      conversation; but she found her busied in some of the common affairs of
      life, and apparently a different person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond, though she made divers attempts, could not lead Caroline back
      again to the same train of thought, or tone of expression. Indeed,
      Rosamond did not attempt it very skilfully, but rather with the awkward
      impatience of one not accustomed to use address. Caroline, intent upon the
      means of assisting the poor young woman whom they had seen at the cottage,
      went there again as soon as she could, to warn old Dorothy, in the first
      place, to be less communicative, and not on any account to mention to any
      one else the names and circumstances which she had told them with so
      little reserve. Caroline next applied to Dr. Leicester, the vicar of their
      former parish, a most amiable and respectable clergyman, who had come from
      his vicarage, near Percy-hall, to spend what time he could spare from his
      duties with his favourite parishioners; at Caroline's request he willingly
      went to see this unhappy young woman, and succeeded in his endeavours to
      soothe and tranquillize her mind by speaking to her words of peace. His
      mild piety raised and comforted the trembling penitent; and while all
      prospect of forgiveness from her parents, or of happiness in this world,
      was at an end, he fixed her thoughts on those better hopes and promises
      which religion only can afford. Her health appeared suddenly to mend when
      her mind was more at ease: but this was only transient, and Dr. Percy, to
      whom Caroline applied for his medical opinion, gave little hopes of her
      recovery. All that could be done by medicine and proper kindness to
      assuage her sufferings during her decline was done in the best manner by
      Mrs. Percy and her daughters, especially by Caroline: the young woman,
      nevertheless, died in six weeks, and was buried without Buckhurst
      Falconer's making any inquiry concerning her, probably without his knowing
      of her death. A few days after she was no more, a letter came to her from
      him, which was returned unopened by Dorothy, who could just write well
      enough to make these words intelligible in the cover:
    </p>
    <p>
      "SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kate Robinson is dead&mdash;this four days&mdash;your child is with me
      still, and well.&mdash;She bid me tell you, if ever you asked more
      concerning her&mdash;she left you her forgiveness on her death-bed, and
      hopes you will be happy, sir.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your humble servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      "DOROTHY WHITE."
    </p>
    <p>
      A bank note of ten pounds was received by Dorothy soon afterwards for the
      use of the child, and deep regret was expressed by the father for the
      death of its mother. But, as Dorothy said, "that came too late to be of
      any good to her."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soon after the death of poor Kate, the attention of the Percy family was
      taken up by a succession of different visits; some from their old
      neighbours and really affectionate friends, some from among the band of
      reproaching condolers. The first we shall mention, who partook of the
      nature of both these classes, was Lady Jane Granville: she was a sincere
      and warm friend, but a tormenting family adviser and director.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship was nearly related to Mr. Percy, which gave her, on this
      occasion, rights of which she knew how to avail herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do her justice, she was better qualified to be an adviser and protector
      than many who assume a familiar tone and character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane Granville was of high birth and fortune, had always lived in
      good company, had seen a great deal of the world, both abroad and at home;
      she had a complete knowledge of all that makes people well received in
      society, had generalized her observations, and had formed them into maxims
      of prudence and politeness, which redounded the more to her credit in
      conversation, as they were never committed to writing, and could,
      therefore, never be brought to the dangerous test of being printed and
      published. Her ladyship valued her own traditional wisdom, and oral
      instruction, beyond any thing that can be learned from books. She had
      acquired a <i>tact</i>, which, disclaiming and disdaining every regular
      process of reasoning, led her with admirable certainty to right
      conclusions in her own concerns, and thus, in some degree, justified the
      peremptory tone she assumed in advising others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though by no means pleased with Mr. and Mrs. Percy's answer to several of
      her letters of counsel, yet she thought it her duty, as a friend and
      relation, to persevere. She invited herself to the Hills, where, with
      great difficulty, through scarcely practicable cross roads, she arrived.
      She was so much fatigued and exhausted, in body and mind, that during the
      first evening she could talk of nothing but her hair-breadth escapes. The
      next morning after breakfast, she began with, "My dear Mr. Percy, now I
      have a moment's ease, I have a thousand things to say to you. I am very
      much surprised that you have thought fit to settle here quite out of the
      world. Will you give me leave to speak my mind freely to you on the
      subject?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As freely as you please, my dear Lady Jane, upon any subject, if you will
      only promise not to be offended, if we should not coincide in opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, certainly; I am sure I never expect or wish any body to submit
      to my opinion, though I have had opportunities of seeing something of the
      world: but I assure you, that nothing but very particular regard would
      induce me to offer my advice. It is a maxim of mine, that family
      interference begins in ill-breeding and ends in impertinence, and
      accordingly it is a thing I have ever particularly avoided. But with a
      particular friend and near relation like you, my dear Mr. Percy, I think
      there ought to be an exception. Now, my dear sir, the young people have
      just left the room&mdash;I can take this opportunity of speaking freely:
      your daughters&mdash;what will you do with them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do with them! I beg pardon for repeating your ladyship's words, but I
      don't precisely understand your question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, precise sir, then, in other words, how do you mean to dispose of
      them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean to dispose of them at all," said Mr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then let me tell you, my good friend," said Lady Jane, with a most
      prophetic tone, "let me tell you, that you will live to repent that.&mdash;You
      know I have seen something of the world&mdash;you ought to bring them
      forward, and make the most of their birth, family, and connexions, put
      them in a way of showing their accomplishments, make proper acquaintance,
      and obtain for your girls what I call the patronage of fashion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Patronage!" repeated Mr. Percy: "it seems to be my doom to hear of
      nothing but patronage, whichever way I turn. What! patronage for my
      daughters as well as for my sons!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Lady Jane, "and look to it; for your daughters will never go
      on without it. Upon their first coming out, you should&mdash;" Here her
      ladyship stopped short, for Caroline and Rosamond returned. "Oh! go on, go
      on, let me beg of your ladyship," said Mr. Percy: "why should not my
      daughters have the advantage of hearing what you are saying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, I will tell them candidly that upon their first <i>coming out</i>,
      it will be an inconceivable advantage, whatever you may think of it, to
      have the patronage of fashion! Every day we see many an ugly face, many a
      mere simpleton, many a girl who had nothing upon earth but her dress,
      become quite charming, when the radiance of fashion is upon them. And
      there are some people who can throw this radiance where and on whom they
      please, just as easily," said Lady Jane, playing with a spoon she held in
      her hand, "just as easily as I throw the sunshine now upon this object and
      now upon that, now upon Caroline and now upon Rosamond. And, observe, no
      eye turns upon the beauteous Caroline now, because she is left in the
      shade."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Percy's policy to allow Lady Jane full liberty to finish all
      she wished to say without interruption; for when people are interrupted,
      they imagine they have much more to add. Let them go on, and they come to
      the end of their sense, and even of their words, sooner than they or you
      could probably expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," continued her ladyship, "to apply to living examples; you know Mrs.
      Paul Cotterel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!&mdash;Lady Peppercorn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor the Miss Blissets?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the misfortune of living so much out of the world!&mdash;But
      there are the Falconers, we all know them at least&mdash;now look at the
      Miss Falconers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! we have not the honour of knowing even the Miss Falconers," said
      Mr. Percy, "though they are our cousins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible that you don't know the Miss Falconers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very possible," replied Mr. Percy: "they live always in town, and we have
      never seen them since they were children: except a visit or two which
      passed between us just after Mrs. Falconer's marriage, we know nothing
      even of her, though we are all acquainted with the commissioner, who comes
      from time to time to this part of the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very clever man is the commissioner in his way," said Lady Jane, "but
      nothing to his wife. I can assure you, Mrs. Falconer is particularly well
      worth your knowing; for unless maternal rivalship should interfere, I know
      few people in the world who could be more useful to your girls when you <i>bring
      them out</i>. She has a vast deal of address. And for a proof, as I was
      going to point out to you, there are the Miss Falconers in the first
      circles&mdash;asked every where&mdash;yet without fortunes, and with no
      pretensions beyond, or equal to, what your daughters have&mdash;not with
      half Rosamond's wit and information&mdash;nothing comparable in point of
      beauty and accomplishments, to Caroline; yet how they have <i>got on</i>!
      See what fashion can do! Come, come, we must court her patronage&mdash;leave
      that to me: I assure you I understand the ways and means."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no doubt of that," said Mr. Percy. "All that your ladyship has
      said is excellent sense, and incontrovertible as far as&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I knew you would think so: I knew we should understand one another as
      soon as you had heard all I had to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent sense, and incontrovertible, as far as it relates to the means,
      but perhaps we may not agree as to the ends; and if these are different,
      you know your means, though the best adapted for gaining your objects, may
      be quite useless or unfit for the attainment of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At once, then, we can't differ as to our objects, for it is my object to
      see your daughters happily married; now tell me," said Lady Jane,
      appealing alternately to Mr. and Mrs. Percy, "honestly tell me, is not
      this your object&mdash;and yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honestly, it is," said Mr. and Mrs. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right&mdash;I knew we must agree there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Mrs. Percy, "allow me to ask what you mean by happily
      married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do I mean? Just what you mean&mdash;what every body means at the
      bottom of their hearts: in the first place married to men who have some
      fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does your ladyship mean by <i>some</i> fortune?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;you have such a strange way of not understanding! We who live
      in the world must speak as the world speaks&mdash;we cannot recur
      continually to a philosophical dictionary, and if we had recourse to it,
      we should only be sent from <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>, and from <i>z</i> back
      again to <i>a</i>; see <i>affluence</i>, see <i>competence</i>, see <i>luxury</i>,
      see <i>philosophy</i>, and see at last that you see nothing, and that you
      knew as much before you opened the book as when you shut it&mdash;which
      indeed is what I find to be the case with most books I read."
    </p>
    <p>
      Triumphant from the consciousness of having hitherto had all the wit on
      her side, Lady Jane looked round, and continued: "Though I don't pretend
      to draw my maxims from books, yet this much I do know, that in matrimony,
      let people have ever so much sense, and merit, and love, and all that,
      they must have bread and butter into the bargain, or it won't do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Mrs. Percy: "under that head I suppose you include all
      the necessaries of life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And some of the luxuries, if you please; for in these days luxuries are
      become necessaries."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A barouche and four, for instance?" said Mrs. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! no, no&mdash;my dear madam, I speak within bounds; you cannot expect
      a barouche and four for girls who have nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect it as little as I wish it for them," said Mrs. Percy, smiling;
      "and as little as my daughters, I believe, desire it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if such a thing should offer, I presume you would not wish that
      Rosamond or Caroline should refuse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That depends upon <i>who</i> offers it," said Mrs. Percy. "But whatever
      my wishes might be, I should, as I believe I safely may, leave my
      daughters entirely at liberty to judge and decide for themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I believe you safely may," said Lady Jane, "as long as you keep them
      here. You might as well talk of leaving them at liberty in the deserts of
      Arabia. You don't expect that knights and squires should come hither in
      quest of your damsels?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you would have the damsels sally forth in quest of the knights and
      squires?" said Mr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them sally forth at any rate," said Lady Jane, laughing; "nobody has
      a right to ask in quest of what. We are not now in the times of ancient
      romance, when young ladies were to sit straight-laced at their looms, or
      never to stir farther than to their bower windows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young ladies must now go a great deal farther," said Mr. Percy, "before
      the discourteous knights will deign to take any notice of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, indeed, it is shameful!" said Lady Jane sighing. "I declare it is
      shameful!" repeated she, indignantly. "Do you know, that last winter at
      Bath the ladies were forced to ask the gentlemen to dance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forced?" said Mr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, forced!" said Lady Jane, "or else they must have sat still all night
      like so many simpletons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sad alternative!" said Mr. Percy; "and what is worse, I understand that
      partners for life are scarcely to be had on easier terms; at least so I am
      informed by one of your excellent modern mothers, Mrs. Chatterton, who has
      been leading her three <i>gawky</i> graces about from one watering-place
      to another these six years, fishing, and hunting, and hawking for
      husbands. 'There now! I have carried my girls to Bath, and to London, and
      to Tunbridge, and to Weymouth, and to Cheltenham, and every where; I am
      sure I can do no more for them.' I assure you," continued Mr. Percy, "I
      have heard Mrs. Chatterton say these very words in a room full of
      company."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a room full of company? Shocking!" said Lady Jane. "But then poor Mrs.
      Chatterton is a fool, you know; and, what is worse, not <i>well mannered</i>,&mdash;how
      should she? But I flatter myself, if you will trust me with your daughter
      Caroline, we should manage matters rather better. Now let me tell you my
      plan. My plan is to take Caroline with me immediately to Tunbridge,
      previous to her London campaign. Nothing can be a greater mistake than to
      keep a young lady <i>up</i>, and prevent her being seen till the moment
      when she is to be brought out: it is of incalculable advantage that,
      previously to her appearance in the great world, she should have been seen
      by certain fashionable <i>prôneurs</i>. It is essential that certain
      reports respecting her accomplishments and connexions should have had time
      to circulate properly."
    </p>
    <p>
      All this Mr. and Mrs. Percy acknowledged, in as unqualified a manner as
      Lady Jane could desire, was fit and necessary to secure what is called a
      young lady's success in the fashionable world; but they said that it was
      not their object to <i>dispose of their daughters</i>, as it is called, <i>to
      the best advantage</i>. The arts which are commonly practised for this
      purpose they thought not only indelicate, but ultimately impolitic and
      absurd; for men in general are now so well aware of them, that they avoid
      the snares, and ridicule and detest those by whom they are contrived. If,
      now and then, a dupe be found, still the chance is, that the match so made
      turns out unhappily; at best, attachments formed in public places, and in
      the hurry of a town life, can seldom be founded on any real knowledge of
      character, or suitableness of taste and temper. "It is much more
      probable," added Mrs. Percy, "that happy marriages should be made where
      people have leisure and opportunities of becoming really and intimately
      acquainted with each other's dispositions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vastly well!" said Lady Jane: "so you mean to bury your daughters in the
      country&mdash;to shut them up, at least&mdash;all the days of their
      unfortunate lives?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Percy, both at the same moment, eagerly declared that they
      had no such absurd or cruel intention towards their daughters. "On the
      contrary," said Mr. Percy, "we shall take every proper occasion, that our
      present fortune and situation will allow, of letting them see agreeable
      and sensible persons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they to spring out of the ground, these agreeable and sensible
      persons?" said Lady Jane. "Whom do you see in this desert, or expect to
      see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We see your ladyship, in the first place," said Mr. Percy: "you cannot
      therefore wonder if we are proud enough to expect to see sometimes good
      company, persons of merit, and even of fashion, though we have lost our
      station and fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is very politely turned by you, Mr. Percy. Much more polite than my
      desert. But I could not bear the thoughts of your sweet pretty Caroline's
      blushing unseen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor could we," said Mr. Percy, "bear the thoughts of her ceasing to blush
      from being too much seen. We could not bear the thoughts of <i>fitting our
      daughters out</i>, and sending them to the London market, with the
      portionless class of matrimonial adventurers, of whom even the few that
      succeed are often doomed but to splendid misery in marriage; and the
      numbers who fail in their venture are, after a certain time, consigned to
      neglect and contempt in single wretchedness. Here, on the contrary, in the
      bosom of their own families, without seeking to entice or entrap, they can
      at all events never be disappointed or degraded; and, whether married or
      single, will be respected and respectable, in youth and age&mdash;secure
      of friends, and of a happy home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happy nonsense! begging your pardon, my dear coz. Shall I tell you what
      the end of all this living in the bosom of their own families will be?&mdash;that
      they will die old maids. For mercy's sake, my dear Mrs. Percy, do not let
      Mr. Percy be philosophical for your daughters, whatever he may be for
      himself. You, I am sure, cannot wish your poor daughters to be <i>old
      maids</i>," said her ladyship, with a tremendous accent upon the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I should wish them to marry, if I could ensure for them good
      husbands, not merely good fortunes. The warmest wish of my heart," cried
      Mrs. Percy, "is to see my daughters as happy as I am myself, married to
      men of their own choice, whom they can entirely esteem, and fondly love.
      But I would rather see my daughters in their graves than see them throw
      themselves away upon men unworthy of them, or sell themselves to husbands
      unsuited to them, merely for the sake of being <i>established</i>, for the
      vulgar notion of <i>getting married</i>, or to avoid the imaginary and
      unjust ridicule of being old maids."
    </p>
    <p>
      The warmth and energy with which these last words were spoken, by so
      gentle a person as Mrs. Percy, surprised Lady Jane so much, that she was
      silent; all her ideas being suddenly at a stand, and her sagacity at
      fault. Mr. Percy proposed a walk to show her the Hills; as her ladyship
      rose to accompany him, she said to herself, "Who could have guessed that
      Mrs. Percy was so romantic?&mdash;But she has caught it from her husband.&mdash;What
      a strange father and mother!&mdash;But for the sake of the poor girls, I
      will not give up the point. I will have Caroline with me to Tunbridge, and
      to town, in spite of their wise heads."
    </p>
    <p>
      She renewed her attack in the evening after tea. Rising, and walking
      towards the window, "A word with you, Mr. Percy, if you please. The young
      people are going to walk, and now we can talk the matter over by
      ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should not we talk it over before the young people?" said Mr. Percy.
      "We always speak of every thing openly in this family," continued he,
      turning to Lady Jane; "and I think that is one reason why we live so
      happily together. I let my children know all my views for them, all my
      affairs, and my opinions, I may say all my thoughts, or how could I expect
      them to trust me with theirs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that, children are bound by gratitude to treat their parents with
      perfect openness," said Lady Jane; "and it is the duty of children, you
      know, to make their parents their confidants upon all occasions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Duty and gratitude are excellent things," said Mr. Percy, "but somewhat
      more is necessary between parent and child to produce friendship.
      Recollect the Duc d'Epernon's reply to his king, who reproached him with
      want of affection. 'Sire, you may command my services, my life; but your
      majesty knows, friendship is to be won only by friendship.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true," said Lady Jane; "but friendship is not, properly speaking,
      the connexion that subsists between parents and children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry you think so," said Mr. Percy, smiling: "pray do not teach my
      children that doctrine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," said Lady Jane, "no matter whether we call it friendship or not; I
      will answer for it, that without any refined notions about perfect
      openness and confidence, your children will be fond of you, if you are
      indulgent to them in certain points. Caroline, my dear," said she, turning
      to Caroline, who was at the farthest end of the room, "don't look so
      unconscious, for you are a party concerned; so come and kneel at the feet
      of this perverse father of yours, to plead your cause and mine&mdash;I
      must take you with me to Tunbridge. You must let me have her a summer and
      winter, and I will answer for Caroline's success."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does your ladyship mean by my success?" said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, child&mdash;Now don't play your father's philosophic airs upon me!
      We people who live in the world, and not with philosophers, are not
      prepared for such entrapping interrogatories. But come, I mean in plain
      English, my dear, though I am afraid it will shock your ears, that you
      will be" (speaking loud) "pretty well admired, pretty well abused, and&mdash;oh,
      shocking!&mdash;pretty well married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty well married!" repeated Mrs. Percy, in a scornful tone: "but
      neither Caroline nor I should be satisfied unless she be very well
      married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heyday! There is no knowing where to have you <i>lady</i> philosophers.
      This morning you did not desire a coach and four for your daughters, not
      you; now you quarrel with me on the other side of the question. Really,
      for a lady of moderation, you are a little exorbitant. <i>Pretty well
      married</i>, you know, implies 2000<i>l.</i> a-year; and very well
      married, nothing under 10,000<i>l.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that the language of the market? I did not understand the exact
      meaning of <i>very well married</i>&mdash;did you, Caroline? I own I
      expect something more than 10,000<i>l.</i> a-year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More!&mdash;you unconscionable wretch! how much more?" said Lady Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Infinitely more," said Mr. Percy: "I expect a man of sense, temper, and
      virtue, who would love my daughter as she deserves to be loved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me advise you," said Lady Jane, in her very gravest tone, "not to
      puff up Caroline's imagination with a parcel of romantic notions.&mdash;I
      never yet knew any good done by it. Depend on it you will be disappointed,
      if you expect a genius to descend from the clouds express for your
      daughters. Let them do as other people do, and they may have a chance of
      meeting with some good sort of men, who will make them as happy as&mdash;as
      happy as their neighbours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how happy is that?" said Caroline: "as happy as we are now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you are now!" said Lady Jane: "a vastly pretty maidenly speech! But
      young ladies, nevertheless, usually think that the saffron robe of Hymen
      would not be the most unbecoming dress in the world; and whether it be in
      compliance with their daughters' taste, or their own convenience, most
      parents are in a hurry to purchase it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes at the expense of their daughters' happiness for life," said
      Mrs. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, lest we should go over the same ground, and get into the same
      labyrinth, where we lost ourselves this morning, let me come to the point
      at once.&mdash;May I hope, Mr. and Mrs. Percy, to have the pleasure of
      Caroline's company at Tunbridge next week, and in town next winter, or
      not?&mdash;That is the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a question which your ladyship will be so good as to ask
      Caroline, if you please," said Mr. Percy; "both her mother and I wish that
      she should decide for herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed?" cried Lady Jane: "then, my dear Caroline, if you please, come
      with me this minute to my dressing-room, and we'll settle it all at my <i>toilette
      de nuit</i>. I have a notion," added her ladyship, as she drew Caroline's
      arm within hers, and led her out of the room, "I have a notion that I
      shall not find you quite so impracticable as your father has shown
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may leave us, Keppel," said Lady Jane to her maid, as she went into
      her dressing-room&mdash;"I will ring when I want you.&mdash;My love," said
      she to Caroline, who stood beside her dressing-table, "why did not you let
      Keppel dress your hair to-day?&mdash;But no matter&mdash;when I once get
      you to town, we'll manage it all our own way. I have a notion that you are
      not of a positive temper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline coloured at this speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see what are you thinking of," said Lady Jane, mistaking her
      countenance; "and to tell you the truth, I also am sadly afraid, by what I
      see, that we shall hardly gain our point. I know your father&mdash;some
      difficulty will be started, and ten to one he will not allow me to have
      you at last, unless you try and persuade him yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never try to persuade my father to do any thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, then, he is not a man to be persuaded?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Caroline, smiling; "but what is much better, he is a man to be
      convinced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better!" exclaimed Lady Jane: "Why surely you had not rather live with a
      man you were to convince than one you could persuade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would it not be safer?" said Caroline: "the arts of persuasion might be
      turned against us by others, but the power of conviction never could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my dear, you are too deep for me," replied Lady Jane. "You said very
      little in our long debate this morning, and I'm afraid I said too much;
      but I own I could not help speaking candidly. Between ourselves, your
      father has some notions, which, you know, are a little odd."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father!" exclaimed Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear, though he is your father, and my relation too, you know one
      cannot be quite blinded by partiality&mdash;and I never would give up my
      judgment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor would I," said Caroline. "Nor I am sure would my father ever desire
      it. You see how freely he permits, he encourages us all to converse with
      him. He is never displeased with any of us for being of a different
      opinion from him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He may not show displeasure," said Lady Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! he does not feel it, ma'am&mdash;I assure you," said Caroline, with
      emotion. "You do not know my father, indeed you do not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," said Lady Jane, retracting, "I know he is an excellent father,
      and I am sure I would have you think so&mdash;it is your duty; but, at the
      same time, you know he is not infallible, and you must not insist," added
      she, sharply, "upon all the world being of one way of thinking.&mdash;My
      dear, you are his favourite, and it is no wonder you defend him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, ma'am," said Caroline, "if I am his favourite, I do not know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, don't mistake me. It is no wonder that you <i>are</i>. You must
      be a favourite with every body; and yet," said Lady Jane, and she paused,
      "as you hinted, perhaps I am mistaken; I think Rosamond seems&mdash;hey?&mdash;Now
      tell me candidly&mdash;which is the favourite?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would if I knew," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! but there must be some favourite in a family&mdash;I know there must;
      and since you will not speak, I guess how it is. Perhaps, if I had asked
      your sister Rosamond to go to town with me next winter, your father would
      have been better pleased, and would have consented more readily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To lose her company if she were his favourite?" said Caroline, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you know, my dear," continued Lady Jane, without hearing or attending
      to this, "you know, my dear, that Rosamond, though a very good girl and
      very sensible, I am sure, yet she has not your personal advantages, and I
      could do nothing for her in town, except, perhaps, introduce her at Mrs.
      Cator's, and Lady Spilsbury's, or Lady Angelica Headingham's conversazione&mdash;Rosamond
      has a mixture of naïveté and sprightliness that is new, and might <i>take</i>.
      If she had more courage, and would hazard more in conversation, if she
      had, in short, <i>l'art de se faire valoir</i>, one could hand her verses
      about, and get her forward in the bel-esprit line. But she must stay till
      we have brought you into fashion, my dear, and another winter, perhaps&mdash;Well,
      my love, I will not keep you up longer. On Monday, if you please, we shall
      go&mdash;since you say you are sure your father is in earnest, in giving
      you leave to decide for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      What was Lady Jane Granville's astonishment, when she heard Caroline
      decline, with polite thanks, her kind invitation!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship stood silent with suspended indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This cannot be your own determination, child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your ladyship's pardon&mdash;it is entirely my own. When a person
      is convinced by good reasons, those reasons surely become their own. But
      independently of all the arguments which I have heard from my father and
      mother, my own feelings must prevent me from leaving home in our present
      circumstances. I cannot quit my parents and my sister, now they are,
      comparatively speaking, in distress. Neither in prosperity nor in
      adversity do I wish to leave my family, but certainly not in adversity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "High-flown notions! Your family is not in any great distress, that I see:
      there is a change, to be sure, in the style of life; but a daughter more,
      you know only increases the&mdash;the difficulties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe my father and mother do not think so," said Caroline; "and till
      they do, I wish to stay with them, and share their fortune, whatever it
      may be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have done&mdash;as you please&mdash;you are to decide for yourself,
      Miss Caroline Percy: this is your final determination?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," said Caroline; "but permit me," added she, taking Lady Jane's
      hand, and endeavouring by the kindest tone of gratitude to avert the
      displeasure which she saw gathering, "permit me to assure you, that I am
      truly grateful for your kindness, and I hope&mdash;I am sure, that I never
      shall forget it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane drew away her hand haughtily. "Permit me to assure you, Miss
      Caroline Percy, that there are few, very few young ladies indeed, even
      among my own nearest relations, to whom I would have undertaken to be <i>chaperon</i>.
      I do not know another young lady in England to whom I would have made the
      offer I have made to you, nor would that offer ever have been made could I
      reasonably have foreseen the possibility of its being refused. Let us say
      no more, ma'am, if you please&mdash;we understand one another now&mdash;and
      I wish you a good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline retired, sorry to have displeased one who had shown so much
      friendly eagerness to serve her, yet not in the least disposed to change
      her determination. The next day Lady Jane's morning face boded no good.
      Mr. and Mrs. Percy in vain endeavoured by all the kind attentions in their
      power to assuage her feelings, but nothing restored her to that sweet
      temper in which she had begun the chapter of advice. She soon announced
      that she had received letters which called her immediately to Tunbridge,
      and her ladyship quitted the Hills, resolving never more to visit
      relations who would not be guided by her opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next persons who came to visit the Percy family in their retirement
      were Mrs. Hungerford and her daughter, Mrs. Mortimer, who had been friends
      and near neighbours whilst they resided at Percy-hall, and whose society
      they had particularly regretted. The distance at which they now lived from
      Hungerford Castle was such, that they had little hope that any intercourse
      could be kept up with its inhabitants, especially as Mrs. Hungerford had
      arrived at that time of life when she was exempted from the ceremony of
      visiting, and she seldom stirred from home except when she went to town
      annually to see her daughter Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So," said Mrs. Hungerford, as Mr. Percy helped her out of her carriage,
      "my good friend, you are surprised at seeing me, are you?&mdash;Ah! you
      thought I was too old or too lazy to come; but I am happy to be able to
      convince you that you are mistaken. See what motive will do! You know Mr.
      Percy says, that people can do any thing they please, and it is certain
      that it pleased me to do this."
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was seated, and Mrs. Percy spoke of the distance from which she
      had kindly come to see them, she answered, "I hear people talk of a <i>visiting
      distance</i>; and I understand perfectly well what it means when
      acquaintance are in question, but for friends there is no <i>visiting
      distance</i>. Remove to the Land's End, and, old as I am, I will pursue
      and overtake you too, tortoise as I seem; and don't depend upon dark
      nights, for every night is full moon to me, when I am bent upon a visit to
      a friend; and don't depend upon hills&mdash;there are no Pyrenees between
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      These sound, perhaps, like mere civil speeches, but they came from one who
      always spoke sincerely, and who was no common person. Mrs. Hungerford was,
      by those who did not know her, thought proud; those who did, knew that she
      had reason to be proud. She was of noble descent, dignified appearance,
      polite manners, strong understanding, and high character. Her fortune,
      connexions, various knowledge, and extraordinary merit, had, during a long
      life, given her means of becoming acquainted with most of the persons of
      any celebrity or worth in her own or in foreign countries. No new
      candidate for fame appeared in any line of life, without desiring to be
      noticed by Mrs. Hungerford; no traveller of distinction or of literature
      visited England without providing himself with letters of introduction to
      Mrs. Hungerford, and to her accomplished daughter, the wife of Admiral
      Mortimer. In her early youth she had passed some years abroad, and had the
      vivacity, ease, polish, <i>tact</i>, and <i>esprit de société</i> of a
      Frenchwoman, with the solidity of understanding, amiable qualities,
      domestic tastes, and virtues of an Englishwoman. The mutual affection of
      this mother and daughter not only secured their own happiness, but
      diffused an additional charm over their manners, and increased the
      interest which they otherwise inspired. Mrs. Mortimer's house in London
      was the resort of the best company, in the best sense of the word: it was
      not that dull, dismal, unnatural thing, an English <i>conversazione</i>,
      where people are set, against their will and their nature, to talk wit; or
      reduced, against their pride and their conscience, to worship <i>idols</i>.
      This society partook of the nature of the best English and the best French
      society, judiciously combined: the French mixture of persons of talents
      and of rank, men of literature and of the world; the French habit of
      mingling feminine and masculine subjects of conversation, instead of
      separating the sexes, far as the confines of their prison-room will allow,
      into hostile parties, dooming one sex to politics, argument, and eternal
      sense, the other to scandal, dress, and eternal nonsense. Yet with these
      French manners there were English morals; with this French ease, gaiety,
      and politeness, English sincerity, confidence, and safety: no <i>simagrée</i>,
      no <i>espionnage</i>; no intrigue, political or gallant; none of that
      profligacy, which not only disgraced, but destroyed the <i>reality</i> of
      pleasure in Parisian society, at its most brilliant era. The persons of
      whom Mrs. Mortimer's society was formed were, in their habits and good
      sense, so thoroughly English, that, even had it been possible for them to
      put morality and religion out of the question, they would still have
      thought it quite as convenient and agreeable to love their own husbands
      and wives as to play at cross-purposes in gallanting their neighbours'. Of
      consequence, Mrs. Mortimer, in the bloom of youth and height of fashion,
      instead of being a coquette, "hunting after men with her eyes," was
      beloved, almost to adoration, as a daughter, a wife, a mother, a friend.
      Mrs. Hungerford, at an advanced age, was not a wretched, selfish Madame du
      Deffand, exacting <i>hommage</i> and <i>attentions</i>, yet disbelieving
      in the existence of friendship; complaining in the midst of all the
      luxuries of life, mental and corporeal, of being oppressed by ennui,
      unable to find any one to love and esteem, or incapable of loving and
      esteeming any one; Mrs. Hungerford, surrounded
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "With all that should accompany old age,
  As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends."
</pre>
    <p>
      was, as she often declared, with gratitude to Providence, happier in age
      than she had been even in youth. With warm affections, and benevolence
      guided and governed in its objects by reason and religion; indulgent to
      human nature in general, and loving it, but not with German cosmopolitism&mdash;first
      and best, loving her daughter, her family, comprising a wide and happy
      extent of relations and connexions, sons and nephews in the army and navy,
      or in different employments in the state: many of these young men already
      distinguished, others wanting only opportunity to do equal honour to their
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the summer, Mrs. Mortimer usually spent some months at Hungerford
      Castle, and generally took with her from town some friends whose company
      she thought would peculiarly suit her mother's taste. Mrs. Hungerford had
      always been in the habit of inviting the Percy family, whenever she had
      any body with her whom she thought they would wish to see or hear; and
      thus the young people, though living retired in the country, had enjoyed
      the advantages of becoming early acquainted with many celebrated literary
      and public characters, and of living in the best society; these were
      advantages which they obtained from their education and their merit; for
      assuredly Mrs. Hungerford would never have troubled herself with them
      merely because they were her neighbours, possessing so many thousand
      pounds a year, and representatives of the Percy interest in the county.&mdash;A
      proof of which, if any were wanting, is, that she never took the least
      notice of those who now held their place at Percy-hall; and the first
      visit she paid when she came to the country, the first visit she had been
      known to pay for years, was to her friends the Percys, after they had lost
      their thousands per annum. So completely was it themselves and not their
      fortune which she had always considered, that she never condoled with
      them, and scarcely seemed to advert to any change in their circumstances.
      She perceived, to be sure, that she was not at Percy-hall; she discovered,
      probably, that she was in a small instead of a large room; the change of
      prospect from the windows struck her eye, and she remarked that this part
      of the country was more beautiful than that to which she had been
      accustomed.&mdash;As to the more or less of show, of dress, or equipage,
      these things did not merely make no difference in Mrs. Hungerford's
      estimation of persons, but in fact scarcely made any impression upon her
      senses or attention. She had been so much accustomed to magnificence upon
      a large scale, that the different subordinate degrees were lost upon her;
      and she had seen so many changes of fashion and of fortune, that she
      attached little importance to these. Regardless of the drapery of objects,
      she saw at once what was substantial and essential. It might, she thought,
      be one man's taste to visit her in a barouche and four, with half-a-dozen
      servants, and another person's pleasure to come without parade or
      attendants&mdash;this was indifferent to her. It was their conversation,
      their characters, their merit, she looked to; and many a lord and lady of
      showy dress and equipage, and vast importance in their own opinions,
      shrunk into insignificance in the company of Mrs. Hungerford; and, though
      in the room with her, passed before her eyes without making a sufficient
      sensation upon her organs to attract her notice, or to change the course
      of her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these <i>peculiarities</i> in this lady's character rendered her
      particularly agreeable to the Percy family in their present circumstances.
      She pressed them to pay her a long visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," said Mrs. Hungerford, "that I had the grace to forbear asking
      this favour till I had possession of my daughter Mortimer, and could bring
      her with me to entice you.&mdash;And my dear young friends, you shall find
      young friends too, as well as old ones, at my house: my nieces, the Lady
      Pembrokes, are to be with me; and Lady Angelica Headingham, who will
      entertain you, though, perhaps, you will sometimes be tired <i>for</i>
      her, she works so hard <i>aux galères de bel-esprit</i>. I acknowledge she
      has a little too much affectation. But we must have charity for
      affectation and its multitude of foibles; for, you know, Locke says that
      it is only a mistaken desire to please. Angelica will find out her
      mistakes in time, and after trying all manners, will hold fast by the best&mdash;that
      is, the most natural: in the mean time, do you, my dear young friends,
      come and admire her as an inimitable actress. Then, Mr. Percy, I have for
      you three temptations&mdash;a man of letters, a man of science, and a man
      of sense. And, for the climax of my eloquence, I have reserved," continued
      she turning to Mrs. Percy, "my appeal to the mother's feelings. Know,
      then, that my son, my eldest hope, my colonel, has arrived from the
      continent&mdash;landed last night&mdash;I expect him home in a few days,
      and you must come and flatter me that he is prodigiously improved by the
      service he has seen, and the wounds which he can show, and assure me that,
      next to your own Godfrey, you would name my Gustavus, of all the officers
      in the army, as most deserving to be our commander-in-chief."
    </p>
    <p>
      An invitation, which there were so many good and kind reasons for
      accepting, could not be refused. But before we go to Hungerford Castle,
      and before we see Colonel Hungerford&mdash;upon whom, doubtless, many a
      one at this instant, as well as Rosamond Percy, has formed designs or
      prognostics in favour of Caroline&mdash;we must read the following letter,
      and bring up the affairs of Alfred and Erasmus.

      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      LETTER FROM ALFRED PERCY TO HIS MOTHER.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Dear Mother,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am shocked by your story of Kate Robinson. I agree with you in
      rejoicing that Caroline had sufficient penetration to see the faults of
      Buckhurst Falconer's character, and steadiness enough, notwithstanding his
      agreeable talents, never to give him any encouragement. I agree with you,
      also, that it was fortunate that her last letter to him was written and
      sent before this affair came to her knowledge. It was much better that she
      should abide by her objection to his general principles than to have had
      explanations and discussions on a subject into which she could not enter
      with propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, as you desire, keep Buckhurst's secret. Indeed, in a worldly
      point of view, it behoves him that it should be carefully kept, because
      Bishop Clay, the prelate, who gave him his present living, though he
      tolerates gormandizing to excess, is extremely strict with his clergy <i>in
      other matters</i>; and, as I once heard Buckhurst say,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Compounds for sins he is inclin'd to,
  By damning those he has no mind to.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      "Buckhurst had, I believe, hopes that Caroline would have relented, in
      consequence of his last overture; he was thrown into despair by her
      answer, containing, as he told me, such a calm and civil repetition of her
      refusal&mdash;that he swears he will never trouble her again. For a
      fortnight after, he protests he was ready to hang himself. About that
      time, I suppose, when he heard of Kate Robinson's death, he shut himself
      up in his rooms for several days&mdash;said he was not well, and could not
      see any body. When he came out again, he looked wretchedly ill, and
      unhappy: I pitied him&mdash;I felt the truth of what Rosamond said, 'that
      there is such a mixture of good and bad in his character, as makes me
      change my opinion of him every half hour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has just done me an essential service. He learnt the other day from
      one of his sisters the secret reason why Lord Oldborough was displeased
      with Godfrey, and why Godfrey was despatched to the West Indies.&mdash;Lord
      Oldborough had been told, either by Cunningham, or by one of his sisters,
      that Godfrey made love to Miss Hauton, and that when he came to town
      ostensibly on some regimental business, and was pleading for a brother
      officer, his concealed motive was to break off the marriage of his
      lordship's niece. Buckhurst had been at the opera in the same box with
      Miss Hauton and with my brother Godfrey one night. Godfrey's conduct had
      been misrepresented, and as soon as Buckhurst found that Lord Oldborough
      had been deceived, he was determined that he should know the truth; or, at
      least, that he should know that my brother was not to blame. Godfrey never
      mentioned the subject to me; but, from what I can understand, the lady
      showed him <i>distinguished attention</i>. How Buckhurst Falconer managed
      to <i>right</i> my brother in Lord Oldborough's opinion without <i>involving</i>
      the young lady, I do not know.&mdash;He said that he had fortunately had
      an opportunity one evening at his father's, when he was playing at chess
      with Lord Oldborough, of speaking to him on that subject, when none of his
      family was watching him. He told me that Lord Oldborough desires to see
      me, and has appointed his hour to-morrow morning. Now, Rosamond, my dear,
      set your imagination to work; I must go and draw a <i>replication</i>,
      which will keep mine fast bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alfred Percy."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed hour, Alfred waited upon the minister, and was received
      graciously. Not one word of Godfrey, however, or of any thing leading to
      that subject. Lord Oldborough spoke to Alfred as to the son of his old
      friend. He began by lamenting the misfortunes which had deprived Mr. Percy
      of that estate and station to which he had done honour. His lordship went
      on to say that he was sorry that Mr. Percy's love of retirement, or pride
      of independence, precluded all idea of seeing him in parliament; but he
      hoped that Mr. Percy's sons were, in this extravagant notion of
      independence, and in this <i>only</i>, unlike their father.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all due deference, Alfred took the liberty of replying to the word <i>extravagant</i>,
      and endeavoured to explain that his father's ideas of independence did not
      go beyond just bounds: Lord Oldborough, contrary to his usual custom when
      he met with any thing like contradiction, did not look displeased; on the
      contrary, he complimented Alfred on his being a good advocate. Alfred was
      going to <i>fall into a commonplace</i>, about a good cause; but from that
      he was happily saved by Lord Oldborough's changing the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up a pamphlet which lay upon his table. It was Cunningham
      Falconer's, that is to say, the pamphlet which was published in
      Cunningham's name, and for which he was mean enough to take the credit
      from the poor starving genius in the garret. Lord Oldborough turned over
      the leaves. "Here is a passage that was quoted yesterday at dinner at
      Commissioner Falconer's, but I don't think that any of the company, or the
      commissioner himself, though he is, or was, a reading man, could recollect
      to what author it alludes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough pointed to the passage: "<i>Thus the fame of heroes is at
      last neglected by their worshippers, and left to the care of the birds of
      heaven, or abandoned to the serpents of the earth.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred fortunately recollected that this alluded to a description in
      Arrian of the island of Achilles, the present Isle of Serpents, where
      there is that temple of the hero, of which, as the historian says, "the
      care is left to the birds alone, who every morning repair to the sea, wet
      their wings, and sprinkle the temple, afterwards sweeping with their
      plumage its sacred pavement."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough smiled, and said, "The author&mdash;the reputed author of
      this pamphlet, sir, is obliged to you for throwing light upon a passage
      which he could not himself elucidate."
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech of Lord Oldborough's alluded to something that had passed at a
      dinner at Lord Skreene's, the day before Cunningham had set out on his
      embassy. Cunningham had been <i>posed</i> by this passage, for which
      Secretary Cope, who hated him, had maliciously complimented him, and
      besought him to explain it. Secretary Cope, who was a poet, made an
      epigram on Cunningham the diplomatist. The lines we do not remember. The
      points of it were, that Cunningham was so complete a diplomatist, that he
      would not commit himself by giving up his authority, even for a quotation,
      and that when he knew the author of an excellent thing, he, with admirable
      good faith, <i>kept it to himself</i>. This epigram remained at the time a
      profound secret to Lord Oldborough. Whilst Cunningham was going with a
      prosperous gale, it was not heard of; but it worked round, according to
      the manoeuvres of courts, just by the time the tide of favour began to
      ebb. Lord Oldborough, dissatisfied with one of Cunningham's despatches,
      was heard to say, as he folded it up, "<i>A slovenly performance</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, at the happy moment, stepped in the rival Secretary Cope, and put
      into his lordship's hands the epigram and the anecdote.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this the reader is to take as a note explanatory upon Lord
      Oldborough's last speech to Alfred, and now to go on with the conversation&mdash;at
      the word <i>elucidate</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspect," continued his lordship, "that Mr. Alfred Percy knows more of
      this pamphlet altogether than the reputed author ever did."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred felt himself change colour, and the genius in the garret rushed
      upon his mind; at the same instant he recollected that he was not at
      liberty to name Mr. Temple, and that he must not betray Cunningham. Alfred
      answered that it was not surprising he should know the pamphlet well, as
      he probably admired it more, and had read it oftener, than the author
      himself had ever done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well parried, young gentleman. You will not allow, then, that you
      had any hand in writing it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my lord," said Alfred, "I had none whatever; I never saw it till it
      was published."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not a right, in politeness, to press the question. Permit me,
      however, to say, that it is a performance of which any man might be
      proud."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should, my lord, be proud&mdash;very proud, if I had written it; but I
      am incapable of assuming a merit that is not mine, and I trust the manner
      in which I now disclaim it does not appear like the affected modesty of an
      author who wishes to have that believed which he denies. I hope I convince
      your lordship of the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot have any doubt of what you assert in this serious manner, sir.
      May I ask if you can tell me the name of the real author?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, my lord&mdash;I cannot. I have answered your lordship with
      perfect openness, as far as I am concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said Lord Oldborough, "I confess that I began this conversation
      with the prepossession that you were equal to a performance of which I
      think highly, but you have succeeded in convincing me that I was mistaken&mdash;that
      you are not equal&mdash;but superior to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this compliment, Alfred, as he thought the force of politeness could
      no farther go, rose, bowed, and prepared to retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you in a hurry to leave me, Mr. Percy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite the contrary, but I was afraid of encroaching upon your lordship's
      goodness; I know that your time is most valuable, and that your lordship
      has so much business of importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps Mr. Alfred Percy may assist me in saving time hereafter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred sat down again, as his lordship's eye desired it.&mdash;Lord
      Oldborough remained for a few moments silent, leaning upon his arm on the
      table, deep in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," said he, "I certainly have, as you say, much business upon my
      hands. But <i>that</i> is not the difficulty; with hands and heads
      business is easily arranged and expedited. I have hands and heads enough
      at my command. Talents of all sorts can be obtained for their price, but
      that which is above all price, integrity, cannot&mdash;there's the
      difficulty&mdash;there is my difficulty. I have not a single man about me
      whom I can trust&mdash;many who understand my views, but none who feel
      them&mdash;'<i>Des ames de boue et de fange!</i>' Wretches who care not if
      the throne and the country perish, if their little interests&mdash;Young
      gentleman," said he, recollecting himself, and turning to Alfred, "I feel
      as if I were speaking to a part of your father when I am speaking to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred felt this, and Lord Oldborough saw that he felt it strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Then</i>, my dear sir," said he, "you understand me&mdash;I see we
      understand and shall suit one another. I am in want of a secretary to
      supply the place of Mr. Cunningham Falconer. Mr. Drakelow is going to
      Constantinople; but he shall first initiate his successor in the business
      of his office&mdash;a routine, which little minds would make great minds
      believe is a mystery above ordinary comprehension. But, sir, I have no
      doubt that you will be expert in a very short time in the technical part&mdash;in
      the routine of office; and if it suits your views, in one word, I should
      be happy to have you for my private secretary. Take time to consider, if
      you do not wish to give an answer immediately; but I beg that you will
      consult no one but yourself&mdash;not even your father. And as soon as
      your mind is made up, let me know your decision."
    </p>
    <p>
      After returning thanks to the minister, who had, by this time, risen to a
      prodigious height in Alfred's opinion; after having reiterated his thanks
      with a warmth which was not displeasing, he retired. The account of his
      feelings on this occasion is given with much <i>truth</i> in his own
      letter, from which we extract the passage:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I felt a little like Gil Blas after his first visit at court.
      Vapours of ambition certainly mounted into my head, and made me a little
      giddy; that night I did not sleep quite so well as usual. The bar and the
      court, Lord Oldborough and my special pleader, were continually before my
      eyes balancing in my imagination all the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>. I
      fatigued myself, but could neither rest nor decide. Seven years of famine
      at the bar&mdash;horrible! but then independence and liberty of conscience&mdash;and
      in time, success&mdash;the certain reward of industry&mdash;well-earned
      wealth&mdash;perhaps honours&mdash;why not the highest professional
      honours? The life of a party-man and a politician, agreed by all who have
      tried, even by this very Lord Oldborough himself, agreed to be an unhappy
      life&mdash;obliged to live with people I despise&mdash;might be tempted,
      like others, to do things for which I should despise myself&mdash;subject
      to caprice&mdash;at best, my fortune quite dependent on my patron's
      continuance in power&mdash;power and favour uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was long before I got my pros and cons even into this rude preparation
      for comparison, and longer still before the logical process of giving to
      each good and evil its just value, and drawing clear deductions from
      distinct premises, could be accomplished. However, in four-and-twenty
      hours I solved the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I waited upon Lord Oldborough to tell him my conclusion. With professions
      of gratitude, respect, and attachment, more sincere, I fancy, than those
      he usually hears, I began; and ended by telling him, in the best manner I
      could, that I thought my trade was more honest than his, and that, hard as
      a lawyer's life was, I preferred it to a politician's.&mdash;You don't
      suspect me of saying all this&mdash;no, I was not quite so brutal; but,
      perhaps, it was implied by my declining the honour of the secretaryship,
      and preferring to abide by my profession. Lord Oldborough looked&mdash;or
      my vanity fancied that he looked&mdash;disappointed. After a pause of
      silent displeasure, he said, 'Well, sir, upon the whole I believe you have
      decided wisely. I am sorry that you cannot serve me, and that I cannot
      serve you in the manner which I had proposed. Yours is a profession in
      which ministerial support can be of little use, but in which talents,
      perseverance, and integrity, are secure, sooner or later, of success. I
      have, therefore, only to wish you opportunity: and if any means in my
      power should occur of accelerating that opportunity, you may depend upon
      it, sir.' said his lordship, holding out his hand to me, 'I shall not
      forget you&mdash;even if you were not the son of my old friend, you have
      made an interest for yourself in my mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thus satisfactorily we parted&mdash;no&mdash;just as I reached the door,
      his lordship added, 'Your brother, Captain Percy&mdash;have you heard from
      him lately?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes, my lord, from Plymouth, where they were driven back by contrary
      winds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ha!&mdash;he was well, I hope?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Very well, I thank your lordship.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's well&mdash;he is a temperate man, I think. So he will stand the
      climate of the West Indies&mdash;and, probably, it will not be necessary
      for his majesty's service that he should remain there long.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bowed&mdash;was again retiring and was again recalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'There was a major in your brother's regiment about whom Captain Percy
      spoke to me&mdash;Major&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Gascoigne, I believe, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Gascoigne&mdash;true&mdash;Gascoigne.' His lordship wrote the name down
      in a note-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bows for the last time&mdash;not a word more on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now that I have written all this to you, my dear mother, I am almost
      ashamed to send it&mdash;because it is so full of egotism. But Rosamond,
      the <i>excuser general</i>, will apologize for me, by pleading that I was
      obliged to tell the truth, and the whole truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love to Caroline, and thanks for her letter.&mdash;Love to Rosamond, upon
      condition that she will write to me from Hungerford Castle, and cheer my
      solitude in London with news from the country, and from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your affectionate son,
    </p>
    <p>
      "ALFRED PERCY.
    </p>
    <p>
      "P.S. I hope you all like O'Brien."
    </p>
    <p>
      We hope the reader will recollect the poor Irishman, whose leg the surgeon
      had condemned to be cut off, but which was saved by Erasmus. A
      considerable time afterwards, one morning, when Erasmus was just getting
      up, he heard a loud knock at his door, and in one and the same instant
      pushing past his servant into his bedchamber, and to the foot of his bed,
      rushed this Irishman O'Brien, breathless, and with a face perspiring joy.
      "I axe your honour's pardon, master, but it's what you're wanting down
      street in all haste&mdash;here's an elegant case for ye, doctor dear!&mdash;That
      painter-jantleman down in the square there beyond that is not <i>expicted</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not expected!" said Erasmus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, not expected: so put on ye with the speed of light&mdash;Where's his
      waistcoat," continued he, turning to Dr. Percy's astonished servant, "and
      coat?&mdash;the top coat, and the wig&mdash;has he one?&mdash;Well! boots
      or shoes give him any way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't clearly understand&mdash;Pray did this gentleman send for
      me?" said Dr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send for your honour! Troth he never thought of it&mdash;no, nor couldn't&mdash;how
      could he? and he in the way he was and is. But God bless ye! and never
      mind shaving, or another might get it afore we'd be back. Though there was
      none <i>in it</i> but myself when I left it&mdash;but still keep on
      buttoning for the life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Erasmus dressed as quickly as he could, not understanding, however, above
      one word in ten that had been said to him. His servant, who did not
      comprehend even one word, endeavoured in vain to obtain an explanation;
      but O'Brien, paying no regard to his solemn face of curiosity, put him
      aside with his hand, and continuing to address Dr. Percy, followed him
      about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Master! you mind my <i>mintioning</i> to you last time I <i>seen</i> your
      honour, that my leg was weak <i>by times</i>, no fault though to the
      doctor that cured it&mdash;so I could not be <i>after carrying</i> the
      weighty loads I used up and down the ladders at every call, so I quit <i>sarving</i>
      the masons, and sought for lighter work, and found an employ that <i>shuted</i>
      me with a 'jantleman painter', grinding of his colours, and that was what
      I was at this morning, so I was, and standing as close to him as I am this
      minute to your honour, thinking of nothing at all just now, please your
      honour, <i>forenent</i> him&mdash;<i>asy</i> grinding, <i>whin</i> he took
      some sort or kind of a fit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fit! Why did you not tell me that sooner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure I <i>tould</i> you he was not <i>expicted</i>,&mdash;that is, if you
      don't know in England, <i>not expicted to live</i>; and sure I <i>tould</i>
      your honour so from the first," said O'Brien. "But then the jantleman was
      as well as I am this minute, that minute afore&mdash;and the <i>nixt</i>
      fell his length on the floor entirely. Well! I set and up again, and, for
      want of better, filled out a thimble-full, say, of the spirits of wine as
      they call it, which he got by good luck for the varnish, and made him take
      it down, and he come to, and I axed him how was he after it?&mdash;Better,
      says he. That's well, says I; and who will I send for to ye, sir? says I.
      But afore he could make answer, I bethought me of your own honour; and for
      fear he would say another, I never troubled him, putting the question to
      him again, but just set the spirits nigh hand him, and away with me here;
      I come off without <i>letting on</i> a word to nobody, good or bad, in
      dread your honour would miss the job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Job!" said Dr. Percy's servant: "do you think my master wants a job?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Lord love ye, and just give his hat. Would you have us be standing on
      ceremony now in a case of life and death?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Percy was, as far as he understood it, of the Irishman's way of
      thinking. He followed as fast as he could to the painter's&mdash;found
      that he had had a slight paralytic stroke, from which he had recovered. We
      need not detail the particulars. Nature and Dr. Percy <i>brought him
      through</i>. He was satisfied with his physician; for Erasmus would not
      take any fee, because he went unsent for by the patient. The painter,
      after his recovery, was one day complimenting Dr. Percy on the inestimable
      service he had done the arts in restoring him to his pencil, in proof of
      which the artist showed many master-pieces that wanted only the finishing
      touch, in particular a huge, long-limbed, fantastic, allegorical piece of
      his own design, which he assured Dr. Percy was the finest example of the
      <i>beau idéal</i>, ancient or modern, that human genius had ever produced
      upon canvas. "And what do you think, doctor," said the painter, "tell me
      what you can think of a connoisseur, a patron, sir, who could stop my
      hand, and force me from that immortal work to a portrait? A portrait!
      Barbarian! He fit to encourage genius! He set up to be a Mecænas! Mere
      vanity! Gives pensions to four sign-post daubers, not fit to grind my
      colours! Knows no more of the art than that fellow," pointing to the
      Irishman, who was at that instant grinding the colours&mdash;<i>asy</i> as
      he described himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And lets me languish here in obscurity!" continued the enraged painter.
      "Now I'll never put another stroke to his Dutch beauty's portrait, if I
      starve&mdash;if I rot for it in jail! He a Mecænas!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The changes upon this abuse were rung repeatedly by this irritated genius,
      his voice and palsied hand trembling with rage while he spoke, till he was
      interrupted by a carriage stopping at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's the patron!" cried the Irishman, with an arch look. "Ay, it's the
      patron, sure enough!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Percy was going away, but O'Brien got between him and the door,
      menacing his coat with his pallet-knife covered with oil&mdash;Erasmus
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I axe your pardon, but don't go," whispered he: "I wouldn't for the best
      coat nor waistcoat ever I seen you went this minute, dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gresham was announced&mdash;a gentleman of a most respectable,
      benevolent, prepossessing appearance, whom Erasmus had some recollection
      of having seen before. Mr. Gresham recognized him instantly: he was the
      merchant whom Erasmus had met at Sir Amyas Courtney's the morning when he
      offended Sir Amyas about the made shell. After having spoken a few words
      to the painter about the portrait, Mr. Gresham turned to Dr. Percy, and
      said, "I am afraid, sir, that you lost a friend at court by your sincerity
      about a shell."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Erasmus could answer&mdash;in less time than he could have thought
      it possible to take off a stocking, a great bare leg&mdash;O'Brien's leg,
      came between Mr. Gresham and Dr. Percy. "There's what lost him a rich
      friend any way, and gained him a poor one, if that would do any good.
      There it is now! This leg! God for ever bless him and reward him for it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with eloquence, emphasis, and action, which came from the heart, and
      went to the heart, the poor fellow told how his leg had been saved, and
      spoke of what Dr. Percy had done for him, in terms which Erasmus would
      have been ashamed to hear, but that he really was so much affected with
      O'Brien's gratitude, and thought it did so much honour to human nature,
      that he could not stop him.&mdash;Mr. Gresham was touched also; and upon
      observing this, Erasmus's friend, with his odd mixture of comedy and
      pathos, ended with this exhortation, "And God bless you, sir! you're a
      great man, and have many to my knowledge under a compliment to you, and if
      you've any friends that are <i>lying</i>, or sick, if you'd recommend them
      to send for <i>him</i> in preference to any other of the doctors, it would
      be a charity to themselves and to me; for I will never have peace else,
      thinking how I have been a hinderance to him. And a charity it would be to
      themselves, for what does the sick want but to be cured? and there's the
      man will do that for them, as two witnesses here present can prove&mdash;that
      jantleman, if he would spake, and myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Erasmus now peremptorily stopped this scene, for he began to feel for
      himself, and to be ashamed of the ridicule which his puffing friend, in
      his zeal, was throwing upon him. Erasmus said that he had done nothing for
      O'Brien except placing him in St. George's Hospital, where he had been
      admirably well attended. Mr. Gresham, however, at once relieved his
      wounded delicacy, and dispelled all fears and anxiety, by the manner in
      which he spoke and looked. He concluded by inviting Dr. Percy to his
      house, expressing with much cordiality a wish to be more intimately
      acquainted with a young gentleman, of whose character he had accidentally
      learned more good than his modesty seemed willing to allow should be
      known.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Brien's eyes sparkled; he rubbed his hands, but restrained himself lest
      Dr. Percy should be displeased. When Erasmus went away, O'Brien followed
      him down stairs, begging his honour's pardon&mdash;if he had said any
      thing wrong or unbecoming, it was through ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to be angry with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We extract from Erasmus's letter to his mother the following account of
      his first visit to Mr. Gresham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I went to see Mr. Gresham, I was directed to an unfashionable part
      of the town, to one of the dark old streets of the city; and from all
      appearance I thought I was going to grope my way into some strange dismal
      den, like many of the ancient houses in that quarter of the town. But, to
      my surprise, after passing through a court, and up an unpromising
      staircase, I found myself in a spacious apartment. The darkness changed to
      light, the smoke and din of the city to retirement and fresh air. A near
      view of the Thames appeared through large windows down to the floor,
      balconies filled with flowers and sweet shrubs!&mdash;It was an Arabian
      scene in London. Rosamond, how you would have been delighted! But I have
      not yet told you that there was a young and beautiful lady sitting near
      the balcony, and her name is Constance: that is all I shall tell you about
      the young lady at present. I must go on with Mr. Gresham, who was in his
      picture-gallery&mdash;yes, picture-gallery&mdash;and a very fine one it
      is. Mr. Gresham, whose fortune is one of those of which only English
      merchants can form any adequate idea, makes use of it in a manner which
      does honour to his profession and to his country: he has patronized the
      arts with a munificence not unworthy of the Medici.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My complaining genius, the painter, who had abused his patron so much,
      was there with his portrait, which, notwithstanding his vow never to touch
      it again, he had finished, and brought home, and with it the sprawling
      Venus: he was now extremely angry with Mr. Gresham for declining to
      purchase this chef-d'oeuvre. With the painter was a poet equally vain and
      dissatisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I admired the mildness with which Mr. Gresham bore with their ill-humour
      and vanity.&mdash;After the painter and poet, to my satisfaction, had
      departed, I said something expressive of my pity for patrons who had to
      deal with the irritable race. He mildly replied, that he thought that a
      man, surrounded as he was with all the comforts and luxuries of life,
      should have compassion, and should make allowance for genius struggling
      with poverty, disease, and disappointment. He acknowledged that he had met
      with much ingratitude, and had been plagued by the pretensions,
      expectations, and quarrels of his tribe of poets and painters. 'For a
      man's own happiness,' said he, 'the trade of a patron is the most dreadful
      he can follow&mdash;gathering samphire were nothing to it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray tell my father this, because it opens a new view, and new
      confirmation of his opinions&mdash;I never spent a more agreeable day than
      this with Mr. Gresham. He converses well, and has a variety of
      information, which he pours forth liberally, and yet without the slightest
      ostentation: his only wish seems to be to entertain and inform those to
      whom he speaks&mdash;he has no desire to shine. In a few hours we went
      over a world of literature. I was proud to follow him, and he seemed
      pleased that I could sometimes anticipate&mdash;I happened to know as well
      as he did the history of the two Flamels, and several particulars of the
      Jesuits in Paraguay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father often told us, when we were boys, that there is no knowledge,
      however distant it seems from our profession, that may not, some time or
      other, be useful; and Mr. Gresham, after he had conversed sufficiently
      with me both on literature and science, to discover that I was not an
      ignorant pretender, grew warm in his desire to serve me. But he had the
      politeness to refrain from saying any thing directly about medicine; he
      expressed only an increased desire to cultivate my acquaintance, and
      begged that I would call upon him at any hour, and <i>give him the
      pleasure of my conversation, whenever I had time</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next morning he called upon me, and told me that he was desired to
      ask my advice for a sick partner of his, to whom, if I would accompany
      him, he would immediately introduce me. Who and what this partner is, and
      of what disease he is dying, if you have any curiosity to know, you shall
      hear in my next, this frank will hold no more&mdash;except love, light as
      air, to all at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear mother, affectionately yours,
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now for the visit to Hungerford Castle&mdash;a fine old place in a
      beautiful park, which excelled many parks of greater extent by the
      uncommon size of its venerable oaks. In the castle, which was sufficiently
      spacious to accommodate with ease and perfect comfort the <i>troops of
      friends</i> which its owner's beneficent character drew round her, there
      were apartments that usually bore the name of some of those persons who
      were considered as the most intimate friends of the family. The Percys
      were of this number. They found their own rooms ready, the old servants of
      the house rejoicing to see them again, and eager in offering their
      services. Many things showed that they had been thought of, and expected;
      yet there was nothing that could remind them that any change had taken
      place in their fortune: no formal or peculiar civilities from the mistress
      of the house, from her daughter, or nieces&mdash;neither more nor less
      attention than usual; but by every thing that marked old habits of
      intimacy and confidence, the Percys were, as if undesignedly and
      necessarily, distinguished from other guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these the most conspicuous was the Lady Angelica Headingham.&mdash;Her
      ladyship had lately come to a large estate, and had consequently produced
      a great sensation in the fashionable world. During the early part of her
      life she had been much and injudiciously restrained. The moment the
      pressure was taken off, the spirit boiled with surprising rapidity:
      immediately Lady Angelica Headingham shone forth a beauty, a bel-esprit,
      and a patroness; and though she appeared as it were <i>impromptu</i> in
      these characters, yet, to do her justice, she supported them with as much
      spirit, truth, and confidence, as if she had been in the habit of playing
      them all her life, and as if she had trod the fashionable stage from her
      teens. There was only one point in which, perhaps, she erred: from not
      having been early accustomed to flattery, she did not receive it with
      quite sufficient <i>nonchalance</i>. The adoration paid to her in her
      triple capacity by crowds of worshippers only increased the avidity of her
      taste for incense, to receive which she would now and then stoop lower
      than became a goddess. She had not yet been suspected of a real partiality
      for any of her admirers, though she was accused of giving each just as
      much encouragement as was necessary to turn his head. Of these admirers,
      two, the most eager and earnest in the pursuit, had followed her ladyship
      to the country, and were now at Hungerford Castle&mdash;Sir James Harcourt
      and Mr. Barclay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James Harcourt was remarkably handsome and fashionable&mdash;completely
      a man of the world, and a courtier: who, after having ruined his fortune
      by standing for government two contested county elections, had dangled
      year after year at court, living upon the hope and promise of a pension or
      a place, till his creditors warning him that they could wait no longer, he
      had fallen in love with Lady Angelica Headingham. Her ladyship's other
      admirer, Mr. Barclay, was a man of considerable fortune, of good family,
      and of excellent sense and character. He had arrived at that time of life
      when he wished to settle to the quiet enjoyment of domestic happiness; but
      he had seen so much misery arise from unfortunate marriages among some of
      his particular friends, that he had been afraid of forming any attachment,
      or, at least, engagement. His acquaintance with fashionable life had still
      further rendered him averse from matrimony; and from love he had defended
      himself with infinite caution, and escaped, till in an unlucky moment he
      had met with Lady Angelica. Against his better judgment, he had been
      captivated by her charms and talents: his reason, however, still struggled
      with his passion&mdash;he had never actually declared his love; but the
      lady knew it probably better than he did, and her caprice and coquetry
      cost him many an agonizing hour. All which he bore with the silence and
      patience of a martyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Percy family saw Lady Angelica for the first time, she was in all
      her glory&mdash;fresh from a successful toilette, conscious of renovated
      powers, with an accumulated spirit of animation, and inspired by the
      ambition to charm a new audience. Though past the bloom of youth, she was
      a handsome showy woman, with the air of one who requires and receives
      admiration. Her attitudes, her action, and the varied expression she threw
      into her countenance, were more than the occasion required, and rather too
      evidently designed to interest or to fascinate. She was surrounded by a
      group of gentlemen; Sir James Harcourt, Mr. Barclay, Mr. Seebright, a
      young poet; Mr. Grey, a man of science; and others&mdash;<i>personnages
      muets</i>. Arduous as was the task, Lady Angelica's various powers and
      indefatigable exertion proved capable of keeping each of these different
      minds in full play, and in high admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauties are always curious about beauties, and wits about wits. Lady
      Angelica had heard that one of the Miss Percys was uncommonly handsome.
      Quick as eye could glance, her ladyship's passed by Mrs. Percy and
      Rosamond as they entered the room, fixed upon Caroline, and was satisfied.
      There was beauty enough to alarm, but simplicity sufficient to remove all
      fears of rivalship. Caroline entered, without any prepared grace or
      practised smile, but merely as if she were coming into a room. Her two
      friends, the Lady Pembrokes, instantly placed her between them, her
      countenance expressing just what she felt, affectionate pleasure at seeing
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sweet pretty creature, really!" whispered Lady Angelica, to her admirer
      in waiting, Sir James Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye&mdash;ye&mdash;yes; but nothing <i>marquante</i>," replied Sir James.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barclay's eye followed, and fixed upon Caroline, with a degree of
      interest. The room was so large, and they were at such a distance from
      Caroline, who was now occupied in listening to her friends, that Lady
      Angelica could continue her observations without fear of being overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is something so interesting in that air of simplicity!" pursued her
      ladyship, addressing herself to Mr. Barclay. "Don't you think there is a
      wonderful charm in simplicity? 'Tis a pity it can't last: it is like those
      delicate colours which always catch the eye the moment they are seen, by
      which I've been taken in a hundred times, and have now forsworn for ever&mdash;treacherous
      colours that fade, and fly even while you look at them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a pity," said Mr. Barclay, withdrawing his eyes from Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thousand pities," said Lady Angelica. "Perhaps, in the country, this
      delicate charm might possibly, and with infinite care and caution, last a
      few years, but in town it would not last a season."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True&mdash;too true," said Mr. Barclay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For which reason," pursued Lady Angelica, "give me something a little
      more durable, something that can stand what it must meet with in the
      world: fashion, for instance, though not half so charming till we are used
      to it; or knowledge, though often dearly bought; or genius, though doubly
      taxed with censure; or wit, though so hard to be had genuine&mdash;any
      thing is better than a faded charm, a has-been-pretty simplicity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When it comes to <i>that</i>, it is lamentable, indeed," said Mr.
      Barclay. He seemed to wish to say something more in favour of simplicity,
      but to be overpowered by wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James shrugged his shoulders, and protested that simplicity had
      something too <i>fade</i> in it, to suit his taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time, where was Colonel Hungerford? He had been expected to
      arrive this day; but a letter came to tell his mother, that he was
      detained by indispensable military business, and that, he feared, he could
      not for some weeks have the pleasure of being at home. Every one looked
      and felt disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So," thought Rosamond, "we shall be gone before he comes, and he will not
      see Caroline!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So!" said Lady Angelica, to herself, "he will not see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond was somewhat comforted for her disappointment, by observing that
      Caroline was not quite lost upon Mr. Barclay, pre-occupied though he was
      with his brilliant mistress. She thought he seemed to notice the marked
      difference there was in their manner of passing the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Angelica, though she would sometimes handle a pencil, touch the harp,
      or take up a book, yet never was really employed. Caroline was continually
      occupied. In the morning, she usually sat with Rosamond and the two Lady
      Pembrokes, in a little room called <i>the Oriel</i>, which opened into the
      great library. Here in happy retirement Caroline and Rosamond looked over
      Mrs. Hungerford's select library, and delighted to read the passages which
      had been marked with approbation. At other times, without disturbing the
      rest of the company, or being disturbed by them, Caroline enjoyed the
      opportunity of cultivating her talents for music and painting, with the
      assistance of her two friends, who eminently excelled in these
      accomplishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time Lady Angelica spent in talking to show her wit, or lounging
      to show her grace. Now and then her ladyship condescended to join the
      young people, when they went out to walk, but never unless they were
      attended by gentlemen. The beauties of nature have come into fashion of
      late, and Lady Angelica Headingham could talk of bold outlines, and
      sublime mountains, the charming effects of light and shade, fine <i>accidents</i>,
      and rich foliage, spring verdure and autumnal tints,&mdash;whilst Caroline
      could enjoy all these things, without expecting to be admired for admiring
      them. Mrs. Mortimer was planting a new shrubbery, and laying out a ride
      through the park. Caroline took an unaffected interest in all her plans,
      whilst Lady Angelica was interested only in showing how much she
      remembered of Price, and Repton, and Knight. She became too hot or too
      cold, or she was tired to death, the moment she ceased to be the principal
      object of attention. But though her ladyship was thus idle by day, she
      sometimes worked hard by night&mdash;hard as Butler is said to have toiled
      in secret, to support the character of an idle universal genius, who knows
      every thing without studying any thing. From dictionaries and extracts,
      abridgments and <i>beauties</i> of various authors, here, and there, and
      every where, she picked up shining scraps, and often by an ostentation of
      superficial knowledge succeeded in appearing in conversation to possess a
      vast extent of literature, and to be deeply skilled in matters of science,
      of which she knew nothing, and for which she had no taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Seebright, the poet, was easily duped by this display: he expressed
      the most flattering astonishment, and pronounced her ladyship to be an
      universal genius. He looked up to Lady Angelica for patronage. He was so
      weak, or so ignorant of the world, as to imagine that the patronage of a
      fashionable literary lady of high rank would immediately guide the opinion
      of the public, and bring a poet forward to fortune and fame. With these
      hopes he performed his daily, hourly duty of admiration to his fair
      patroness, with all possible zeal and assiduity; but it was observed by
      Rosamond that, in conversation, whenever Mr. Seebright had a new idea or a
      favourite allusion to produce, his eye involuntarily turned first to
      Caroline; and though he professed, on all points of taste and criticism,
      to be implicitly governed by Lady Angelica Headingham, there was "a small
      still voice" to which he more anxiously listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Mr. Grey, the roan of science&mdash;he soon detected Lady Angelica's
      ignorance; smiled in silence at her blunders, and despised her for her <i>arts
      of pretence</i>. In vain, to win his suffrage, she produced the letters of
      various men of note and talent with whom she was in correspondence; in
      vain she talked of all the persons of rank who were her relations or dear
      friends:&mdash;she should be so happy to introduce him to this great man,
      or to mention him to that great lady; she should be so proud, on her
      return to town, to have Mr. Grey at her <i>esprit parties</i>; she would
      have such and such celebrated characters to meet him, and would have the
      pleasure and honour of introducing him to every person worth knowing in
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all due civility Mr. Grey declined these offers. There were few
      persons the pleasure or honour of whose company could compensate to him
      for the loss of his time, or equal the enjoyment he had in his own
      occupations; and those few he was so happy to have for his friends, he did
      not wish to form new acquaintance&mdash;he never went to <i>conversaziones</i>&mdash;he
      was much obliged to her ladyship, but he did not want to be <i>mentioned</i>
      to great men or great women. The nature of his fame was quite independent
      of fashion.&mdash;In this respect men of science have much the advantage
      of men of taste. Works of taste may, to a certain degree, be <i>cried up</i>
      or <i>cried down</i> by fashion. The full-fledged bard soars superior, and
      looks down at once upon the great and little world; but the young poet, in
      his first attempts to rise, is often obliged, or thinks himself obliged,
      to have his wing impelled by patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all her resources, however, both of patronage and of <i>bel-esprit</i>,
      Lady Angelica was equally surprised and mortified to find herself foiled
      at her own arms, by a girl whom nobody knew. She changed her manoeuvres&mdash;she
      thought she could show Miss Caroline Percy, that, whatever might be her
      abilities, her knowledge, or her charms, these must all submit to the
      superior power of fashion. Caroline having lived in the country, could not
      know much of the world of fashion. This was a world from which she thought
      she could move every other at pleasure. Her conversation was no longer of
      books, of which all of equal talents were competent to form a judgment;
      but her <i>talk</i> was now of persons, with whom no one who had not lived
      in the great world could pretend to be acquainted, of whom they could not
      presume to judge. Her ladyship tried in vain to draw Mrs. Hungerford and
      Mrs. Mortimer to her aid; they were too well-bred to encourage this
      exclusive and unprofitable conversation. But her ladyship knew that she
      could be sufficiently supported by Sir James Harcourt! He prided himself
      upon knowing and being known to <i>every body</i>, that is, <i>any body</i>,
      in London; he had an inexhaustible fund of town and court anecdote. What
      an auxiliary for Lady Angelica! But though their combined operations were
      carried on with consummate skill, and though the league offensive was
      strictly kept with every demonstration of mutual amity that could excite
      jealousy or express contempt for rival powers; yet the ultimate purpose
      was not gained&mdash;Caroline was not mortified, and Mr. Barclay was not
      jealous; at least, he was not sufficiently jealous to afford a clear
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, when she had been playing off all her graces, while Sir James
      admired her in every Proteus form of affectation, Mr. Barclay, as she
      thought, evidently pained by her coquetry, retired from the sofa, where
      she sat, and went to Mrs. Hungerford's table, where he took up a book and
      began to read. Lady Angelica spared no art to distract his attention: she
      contrived for herself an employment, which called forth continual
      exclamations of admiration, joy, despair, which at first made Mr. Barclay
      turn to see by what they could be caused; but when he found that they were
      occasioned only by the rise or fall of a house of cards which she was
      building, he internally said, "Pshaw!" and afterwards kept his eyes fixed
      upon his book. Sir James continued to serve the fair architect with the
      frail materials for her building&mdash;her <i>Folly</i>, as she called it&mdash;and
      for his services he received much encouragement of smiles, and many marked
      commendations. Mrs. Hungerford called upon Mr. Barclay to read a favourite
      poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barclay read remarkably well, and soon fixed the attention of all the
      company, except that of Lady Angelica and her knight, Sir James Harcourt,
      whom she detained in her service. She could not be so flagrantly rude as
      to interrupt the reader by audible exclamations, but by dumb-show, by a
      variety of gestures and pretty looks of delight at every fresh story added
      to her card edifice, and at every motion of terror lest her tower should
      fall, her ladyship showed Mr. Barclay that she was not listening to that
      which she knew he was particularly desirous that she should hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment the reader's voice ceased, Lady Angelica approached the table.
      "Ten millions of pardons!" said she, drawing some cards from beneath Miss
      Caroline Percy's elbow, which rested on them. "Unpardonable wretch that I
      am, to have disturbed such a reverie&mdash;and such an attitude! Mr.
      Barclay," continued her ladyship, "now if you have leisure to think of me,
      may I trouble you for some of your little cards for the attic of my dear
      Folly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barclay coolly presented the cards to her ladyship: then looked out of
      the window, observed that his horse was at the door, and was following Mr.
      Percy out of the room, when Lady Angelica, just as Mr. Barclay passed,
      blew down her tower, and exclaimed, "There's an end of my folly&mdash;of
      one of my follies, I mean: I wish I could blow them all away so easily."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sigh and look of penitence with which she pronounced these words were
      accepted as expiation&mdash;Mr. Barclay stopped and returned; while
      sweeping the wreck of her tower from the table, she repeated,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Easy, as when ashore an infant stands,
  And draws imagined houses on the sands,
  The sportive wanton, pleased with some new play,
  Sweeps the slight works and fancied domes away:
  Thus vanish at thy touch the tow'rs and walls,
  The toil of <i>mornings</i> in a moment falls."
</pre>
    <p>
      "Beautiful lines!" said Mr. Barclay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And charmingly repeated," said Sir James Harcourt: "are they your
      ladyship's own?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; Homer's," said she, smiling; "Pope's Homer's, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      To cover his blunder as fast as possible, Sir James went on to something
      else, and asked what her ladyship thought of Flaxman's sketches from the
      Iliad and Odyssey? He had seen the book lying on the library table
      yesterday: indeed, his eye had been caught, as it lay open, by a striking
      resemblance&mdash;he knew it was very rude to talk of likenesses&mdash;but,
      really, the resemblance was striking between a lady he had in his view,
      and one of the figures in Flaxman, of Venus, or Penelope, he could not say
      which, but he would look for the book and see in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book was not to be found on the library table; Mrs. Hungerford said
      she believed it was in the Oriel: Sir James went to look&mdash;Miss
      Caroline Percy was drawing from it&mdash;that was unlucky, for Mr. Barclay
      followed, stayed to admire Miss Percy's drawings, which he had never seen
      before, and in looking over these sketches of hers from Flaxman's Homer,
      and from Euripides and Æschylus, which the Lady Pembrokes showed him, and
      in speaking of these, he discovered so much of Caroline's taste,
      literature, and feeling, that he could not quit the Oriel. Lady Angelica
      had followed to prevent mischief, and Mrs. Hungerford had followed to
      enjoy the pleasure of seeing Caroline's modest merit appreciated. Whilst
      Mr. Barclay admired in silence, Sir James Harcourt, not with his usual
      politeness, exclaimed, "I protest I had no notion that Miss Caroline Percy
      drew in this style!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's possible," cried Lady Mary Pembroke, colouring with that prompt
      indignation which she was prone to feel when any thing was said that
      seemed derogatory to her friends, "that's possible, Sir James; and yet you
      find Miss Caroline Percy does draw in this very superior style&mdash;yes,
      and it is the perfection of her accomplishments, that they are never
      exhibited."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have always the pleasure of discovering them," said Mrs. Hungerford;
      "they are as a woman's accomplishments and acquirements ought to be, more
      retiring than obtrusive; or as my old friend, Dr. South, quaintly but
      aptly expresses it&mdash;more in intaglio than in cameo."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant a sudden scream was heard from Lady Angelica Headingham,
      who caught hold of Mr. Barclay's arm, and writhed as if in agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens! What is the matter?" cried Mr. Barclay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! cramp! cramp! horrid cramp! in my foot&mdash;in my leg!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rest upon me," said Mr. Barclay, "and stretch your foot out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Torture!&mdash;I can't." It was impossible that she could stand without
      the support of both gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carry me to the sofa&mdash;there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had carried her out of the Oriel to the sofa in the library, and
      when her ladyship found that she had excited sufficient interest, and
      drawn the attention of Mr. Barclay away from Caroline, her ladyship began
      to grow a little better, and by graceful degrees recovered the use of her
      pretty limbs. And now, as she had reason to be satisfied with the degree
      of feeling which Mr. Barclay had involuntarily shown for her when he
      thought she was suffering, if her vanity had had any touch of gratitude or
      affection mixed with it, she would not have taken this moment to torment
      the heart of the man&mdash;the only man who ever really loved her; but all
      in her was vanity: she began to coquet with Sir James Harcourt&mdash;she
      let him put on her sandal and tie its strings&mdash;she sent him for her
      shawl, for she had a mind to walk in the park&mdash;and when Mr. Barclay
      offered to attend her, and when she found that Caroline and the Lady
      Pembrokes were going, she had a mind not to go, and she resolved to detain
      them all in admiration of her. She took her shawl from Sir James, and
      throwing it round her in graceful drapery, she asked him if he had ever
      seen any of Lady Hamilton's attitudes, or rather scenic representations
      with shawl drapery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he had; but he should be charmed to see them in perfection from her
      ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the hint Mrs. Hungerford had given about <i>exhibiting</i>,
      and notwithstanding Mr. Barclay's grave looks, Lady Angelica, avowedly to
      please Sir James Harcourt, consented to give the exhibition of the
      passions. She ran into the Oriel&mdash;attired herself in a most
      appropriate manner, and appeared first in the character of Fear&mdash;then
      of Hope: she acted admirably, but just as
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Hope enchanted, smiled, and waved her golden hair,"
</pre>
    <p>
      her ladyship's auburn tresses caught on some ornament in the room. The
      whole fabric was raised a little from the fair head on which it seemed to
      grow&mdash;Caroline sprang forward instantly, and dexterously
      disentangling the accomplished actress, relieved her from this imminent
      and awkward peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure I'm exceedingly obliged to Miss Caroline Percy," said her
      ladyship, adjusting her head-dress. "There, now, all's right again&mdash;thank
      you, Miss Percy&mdash;don't trouble yourself, pray."
    </p>
    <p>
      The heartless manner of these thanks, and her ladyship's preparing to go
      on again with her exhibition, so displeased and disgusted Mr. Barclay,
      that he left her to the flattery of Sir James Harcourt, and, sighing
      deeply, quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Angelica, proud of showing her power of tormenting a man of his
      sense, smiled victorious; and, in a half whisper, said to Mrs. Hungerford,
      "Exit Mr. Barclay, jealous, because he thinks I did the shawl attitudes
      for Sir James, and not for him&mdash;Poor man! he's very angry; but he'll
      ride it off&mdash;or I'll smile it off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hungerford shook her head. When her ladyship's exhibition had
      finished, and when Sir James had continued repeating, either with his
      words or his looks, "Charming! Is not she charming?" till the time of
      dressing, an hour to which he was always punctual, he retired to his
      toilette, and Lady Angelica found herself alone with Mrs. Hungerford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! how tired I am!" cried her ladyship, throwing herself on a sofa
      beside her. "My spirits do so wear me out! I am sure I'm too much for you,
      Mrs. Hungerford; I am afraid you think me a strange wild creature: but,
      dear madam, why do you look so grave?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Lady Angelica Headingham," said Mrs. Hungerford, in a serious but
      affectionate tone, laying her hand upon Lady Angelica's as she spoke, "I
      was, you know, your mother's most intimate friend&mdash;I wish to be
      yours. Considering this and my age, I think I may venture to speak to you
      with more freedom than any one else now living could with propriety&mdash;it
      grieves me to see such a woman as you are, being spoiled by adulation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my dear Mrs. Hungerford! and now do tell me all my faults,"
      said Lady Angelica: "only first let me just say, that if you are going to
      tell me that I am a coquette, and a fool, I know I am&mdash;both&mdash;and
      I can't help it; and I know I am what some people call <i>odd</i>&mdash;but
      I would not for the world be a common character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you must not be a coquette," said Mrs. Hungerford, "for that <i>is</i>
      common character&mdash;the hackneyed character of every play, of every
      novel. And whatever is common is vulgar, you know: airs and affectation
      are common and paltry&mdash;throw them aside, my dear Lady Angelica;
      disdain flattery, prove that you value your own esteem above vulgar
      admiration, and then, with such beauty and talents as you possess, you may
      be what you admire, an uncommon character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>May</i>be!" repeated Lady Angelica in a voice of vexation. "Well, I
      know I have a hundred faults; but I never before heard any body, friend or
      enemy, deny that I <i>am</i> an uncommon character. Now, Mrs. Hungerford,
      do you know any one of a more uncommon character?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Mrs. Hungerford, smiling, "I know the thing that's most
      uncommon,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'I know a reasonable woman,
  Handsome and witty, yet a friend.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      "Oh! your friend, Miss Caroline Percy, I suppose. Well! though she is so
      great a favourite of yours, I must say that, to my fancy, she is as little
      of an uncommon character as any girl I ever saw&mdash;uncommon beauty, I
      acknowledge, she has, though not the style of face I like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And an uncommonly good understanding, without one grain of envy,
      affectation, or vanity," said Mrs. Hungerford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vanity!&mdash;Stay till you see her tried," said Lady Angelica; "stay
      till she has gone through one winter's campaign in London; stay till she
      has as many admirers as&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you have," said Mrs. Hungerford, smiling. "She seems to be in a fair
      way of soon trying that experiment to your satisfaction."
    </p>
    <p>
      A considerable pause ensued; during which many conflicting passions
      appeared in Lady Angelica's countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all, Mrs. Hungerford," resumed she, "do you think Mr. Barclay is
      really attached to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he <i>was</i> really attached to you, and strongly: but you have
      been doing all you can to weaken and destroy his attachment, I fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fear nothing! I fear nothing," exclaimed Lady Angelica, "now you tell me,
      dear Mrs. Hungerford, that you do not doubt the <i>reality</i> of his
      love: all the rest I will answer for&mdash;trust to me, I know my game."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hungerford sighed; and replied, "I am old, have stood by, and seen
      this game played and lost so often, and by as able players as Lady
      Angelica Headingham&mdash;take care&mdash;remember I warn you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Caroline Percy came into the room at this instant&mdash;Lady Angelica
      went to her toilette to repair her charms.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Mrs. Hungerford was wasting her good advice upon Lady Angelica, Sir
      James Harcourt at his toilette received this day's letters, which he read,
      as usual, while his hair was dressing. Some of these letters were from
      creditors, who were impatient to hear when his <i>advantageous marriage</i>
      would be concluded, or when he would obtain that place which had been so
      long promised. The place at court, as he was by this post informed by a <i>private,
      very confidential</i> letter, under a government cover and huge seal, from
      his intimate friend, my Lord Skreene, ministers had found themselves under
      the unfortunate necessity of giving away, to secure three votes on a
      certain cabinet question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James threw the letter from him, without reading the rest of his dear
      friend's official apologies: "So, the place at court is out of the
      question&mdash;a wife must be my last resource," thought he, "but how to
      bring her to the point?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James knew that though he was now in high favour, he might, at some
      sudden turn of caprice, be discarded or deserted by his fair one, as had
      been the fate of so many of his predecessors. The ruling passion, vanity,
      must be touched, and the obvious means of awakening jealousy were in his
      power. He determined to pay attentions to Miss Caroline Percy: his
      experience in the tactics of gallantry supplying the place of knowledge of
      the human heart, he counterfeited the symptoms of a new passion, and acted
      "The Inconstant" so well, that Lady Angelica had no doubt of his being
      what be appeared. She was not prepared for this turn of fate, well as she
      thought she knew her game, and at this unlucky moment, just when she
      wanted to play off Sir James against Mr. Barclay&mdash;and in an old
      castle in the country too, where no substitute was to be had!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship was the more vexed, because Mrs. Hungerford must see her
      distress. Unused to any thing that opposed her wishes, she lost all
      temper, and every word and look manifested resentment and disdain towards
      her innocent and generous rival. In this jealousy, as there was no mixture
      of love to colour and conceal its nature, it could not pass for refinement
      of sentiment&mdash;it bore no resemblance to any thing noble&mdash;it must
      have been detected, even by a less penetrating and less interested
      observer than Mr. Barclay. His eyes were now completely opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, Caroline's character, the more it was brought into
      light, the more its value, goodness, and purity appeared. In the education
      of a beauty, as of a prince, it is essential early to inspire an utter
      contempt of flattery, and to give the habit of observing, and consequently
      the power of judging, of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline, on this occasion, when, perhaps, some little temptation might
      have been felt by some ladies, remembered her own prayer against coquetry&mdash;her
      manner towards Sir James was free from all possibility of reproach or
      misconstruction: and by simply and steadily adhering to the truth, and
      going the straight road, she avoided all the difficulties in which she
      would have been involved, had she deviated but for a moment into any
      crooked path.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to Lady Angelica Headingham. She was pleased to see Sir
      James Harcourt disconcerted, and delighted to see him mortified. Her
      ladyship's disdainful manner towards Caroline was thrown aside,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "And all the cruel language of the eye"
</pre>
    <p>
      changed at once. Lady Angelica acknowledged that no one could show more
      magnanimity than Miss Caroline Percy had displayed in her conduct to Sir
      James Harcourt. This speech was made of course to be repeated, and when
      Caroline heard it she could not help smiling at the word magnanimity,
      which sounded to her rather too grand for the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James Harcourt finding himself completely foiled in his schemes, and
      perceiving that the parties were closing and combining in a manner which
      his knowledge of the world had not taught him to foresee, endeavoured with
      all possible address and expedition to make his separate peace with Lady
      Angelica. Her ladyship, however, was proud to show that she had too much
      sense and spirit to accept again the homage of this recreant knight. He
      had not time to sue for pardon&mdash;his adventure might have ended in a
      jail; so forthwith he took his departure from Hungerford Castle,
      undetermined whether he should again haste to court to beg a place, or
      bend his course to the city, there to barter his fashion against the solid
      gold of some merchant, rolling in his majesty's coin, who might be silly
      enough to give his daughter, for a bow, to a courtier without a shilling.
      On one point, however, Sir James was decided&mdash;betide him weal, betide
      him woe&mdash;that his next mistress should neither be a wit, nor a
      beauty, nor yet a patroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the departure of the baronet, the Lady Angelica expected to find her
      remaining lover at her feet, in transports of joy and gratitude for this
      haughty dismissal of his rival. No such thing: Mr. Barclay seemed disposed
      to throw himself at the feet of another, and of the last person in the
      world at whose feet her ladyship could bear to think of seeing him. Yet if
      she had even now taken Mrs. Hungerford's friendly warning, she might still
      have saved herself from mortification; but she was hurried on by her evil
      genius&mdash;the spirit of coquetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had promised to pay a visit this summer to an aunt of Mr. Barclay,
      Lady B&mdash;&mdash;, who lived in Leicestershire. And now, when every
      thing was arranged for her reception, Lady Angelica changed her mind, and
      told Mr. Barclay that she could not go, that she had just received letters
      from town, from several of her fashionable friends, who were setting out
      for Weymouth, and who insisted upon her meeting them there&mdash;and there
      was a delightful Miss Kew, a protégée of hers, who was gone to Weymouth in
      the hope and trust that her ladyship would <i>produce</i> her and her new
      novel at the reading parties which Lady Angelica had projected. She
      declared that she could not possibly disappoint Miss Kew; besides, she had
      promised to carry Mr. Seebright to Weymouth, to introduce him and his poem
      to her friends&mdash;his subscription and the success of his poem entirely
      depended upon her going to Weymouth&mdash;she could not possibly
      disappoint <i>him</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barclay thought more of his own disappointment&mdash;and said so: at
      which her ladyship rejoiced, for she wished to make this a trial of her
      power; and she desired rather that her reasons should not appear valid,
      and that her excuses should not be reasonable, on purpose that she might
      compel Mr. Barclay to submit to her caprice, and carry him off in triumph
      in her train.
    </p>
    <p>
      She carelessly repeated that Leicestershire was out of the question at
      this time, but that Mr. Barclay might attend her, if he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it did not please him: he did not think that his aunt was properly
      treated, and he preferred her to all the bel-esprits and fine ladies who
      were going to Weymouth&mdash;her charming self excepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She depended too much on the power of that charming self. Mr. Barclay,
      whose bands she had gradually loosened, now made one resolute effort,
      asserted and recovered his liberty. He declared that to Weymouth he could
      not have the honour of attending her: if her ladyship thought the claims
      and feelings of her protégées of greater consequence than his, if she held
      herself more bound by the promises she had given to Mr. Seebright, Miss
      Kew, or any of her bel-esprit friends, than by those with which she had
      honoured his aunt, he could not presume to dispute her pleasure, or
      further to press Lady B.'s request; he could only lament&mdash;and submit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Angelica flattered herself that this was only a bravado, or a
      temporary ebullition of courage, but, to her surprise and dismay, Mr.
      Barclay continued firm, calm, and civil. His heart now turned to the
      object on which his understanding had long since told him it should fix.
      He saw that Miss Caroline Percy was all that could make him happy for
      life, if he could win her affections; but of the possibility of succeeding
      he had great doubts. He had, to be sure, some circumstances in his favour:
      he was of a good family, and had a considerable fortune; in a worldly
      point of view he was a most advantageous match for Caroline Percy, but he
      knew that an establishment was not the <i>first</i> object, either with
      her, or with her parents; neither could he wish that any motives of
      interest should operate in his favour. His character, his principles, were
      good, and he had reason to believe that Mr. Percy was impressed with a
      highly favourable opinion of his good sense and general understanding.
      Caroline talked to him always as if she liked his conversation, and felt
      esteem for his character; but the very freedom and ease of her manner
      showed that she had no thoughts of him. He was many years older than
      Caroline: it did not amount to an absolute disparity, but it was an
      alarming difference. Mr. Barclay, who estimated himself with perfect
      impartiality and candour, was sensible that though his temper was good,
      yet that he was somewhat fastidious, and though his manners were polite,
      yet they were reserved&mdash;they wanted that amenity, gaiety, and
      frankness, which might be essential to win and keep a lady's heart. The
      more his love, the more doubts of his own deserts increased; but at last
      he determined to try his fate. He caught a glimpse of Caroline one morning
      as she was drawing in the Oriel. Her sister and the two Lady Pembrokes
      were in the library, and he thought he was secure of finding her alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I beg the favour of a few minutes?"&mdash;he began with a voice of
      much emotion as he entered the room; but he stopped short at the sight of
      Lady Angelica.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of all the rouge she wore, her ladyship's change of colour was
      striking. Her lips trembled and grew pale. Mr. Barclay's eyes fixed upon
      her for one moment with astonishment, then turning calmly away, he
      addressed himself to Caroline, his emotion recurring, though he merely
      spoke to her of a drawing which she was examining, and though he only
      said, "Is this yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Lady Angelica has just given it to me; it is one of her drawings&mdash;a
      view of Weymouth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very beautiful," said Mr. Barclay, coldly&mdash;"a view of Weymouth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where I hope to be the day after to-morrow," cried Lady Angelica,
      speaking in a hurried, piqued, and haughty voice&mdash;"I am dying to get
      to Weymouth. Mr. Barclay, if you have any letters for your friends there,
      I shall be happy to carry them. Only let them be given to my woman in
      time," added her ladyship, rising; "and now I must go and say <i>vivace!
      presto! prestissimo!</i> to her preparations. Well, have you any
      commands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No commands&mdash;but my best wishes for your ladyship's health and
      happiness, whenever and wherever you go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Angelica sunk down upon her seat&mdash;made a strong effort to rise
      again&mdash;but was unable. Caroline, without appearing to take any notice
      of this, turned to Mr. Barclay, and said, "Will you have the goodness now
      to give me the book which you were so kind as to promise me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barclay went in search of it. Caroline proceeded with her drawing,
      gave Lady Angelica time to recover, and left her the hope that her
      perturbation had not been noticed. Her ladyship, as soon as she could,
      left the room, repeating that she had some orders to give for her
      departure. Caroline waited some time in vain for Mr. Barclay and his book.
      Afterwards, as she was going up stairs, she was met by Rosamond, who, with
      a face full of mystery, whispered, "Caroline, my father wants you this
      instant in my mother's dressing-room&mdash;Mr. Barclay," added she, in a
      low voice, and nodding her head, "Oh! I see you know what I mean&mdash;I
      knew how it would be&mdash;I said so last night. Now go to my father, and
      you will hear all the particulars."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline heard from her father the confirmation of Rosamond's
      intelligence, and she received from him and from her mother the kind
      assurance that they would leave her entirely at liberty to accept or
      refuse Mr. Barclay, according as her own judgment and feelings might
      dictate. They said, that though it might be, in point of fortune, a highly
      advantageous match, and though they saw nothing to which they could object
      in his character, understanding, and temper, yet they should not attempt
      to influence her in his favour. They begged her to decide entirely for
      herself, and to consult only her own happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I insist upon, my dear daughter, is, that you should, without any
      idle or unjust generosity, consider first and solely what is for your own
      happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for Mr. Barclay's," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for Mr. Barclay's, as far as you are concerned: but, remember, the
      question he asks you is, whether you can love him, whether you will marry
      him, not whether you would advise him to love or marry somebody else?
      Don't I know all that passes in your mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not all, perhaps," said Caroline, "nor can I tell it you, because it is
      another person's secret; therefore, I am sure you will not question me
      further: but since you are so kind as to trust to my judgment, trust to it
      entirely, when I assure you that I will, without any idle or unjust
      generosity, consider, principally, what is for my own happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am satisfied," said Mr. Percy, "no&mdash;one thing more: without
      meaning or wishing to penetrate into any other person's affairs, I have a
      full right to say to my daughter all that may be necessary to assist her
      in deciding on a point the most material to her happiness. Now, Caroline,"
      continued her father, looking away from her, "observe, I do not endeavour,
      from my knowledge of your countenance, even to guess whether what I
      imagine is fact; but I state to you this supposition&mdash;suppose you had
      been told that another lady is attached to Mr. Barclay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never was told so," interrupted Caroline, "but I have discovered it by
      accident&mdash;No, I have said too much&mdash;I do not think <i>that
      person</i> is attached to him, but that she might easily have become
      attached, if this proposal had been made to her instead of to me; and I
      think that their two characters are exactly suited to each other&mdash;much
      better suited than mine could be to Mr. Barclay, or his to me: she has wit
      and imagination, and great vivacity; he has judgment, prudence, and solid
      sense: in each there is what would compensate for what is wanting in the
      other, and both together would make a happy union."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Caroline," said her father, "I must put you upon your guard
      against the too easy faith of a sincere affectionate heart. I am really
      surprised that you, who have always shown such good judgment of character,
      should now be so totally mistaken as to think a woman capable of a real
      love who is merely acting a part from vanity and coquetry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vanity! coquetry!" repeated Caroline: "nobody upon earth is more free
      from vanity and coquetry than&mdash;Surely you do not imagine I am
      thinking of Lady Angelica Headingham?&mdash;Oh! no; I have no compassion
      for her. I know that if she suffers from losing Mr. Barclay, it will be
      only from losing 'the dear delight of giving pain,' and I should be very
      sorry she ever again enjoyed that delight at Mr. Barclay's expense. I
      assure you, I am not thinking of Lady Angelica."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Mr. and Mrs. Percy were in doubt whether Caroline was thinking of her
      sister Rosamond or of her friend Lady Mary Pembroke; but without
      attempting to discover, they only repeated that, whoever the person in
      question might be, or however amiable or dear to Caroline, she ought not
      to let this idea interfere with her own happiness, or influence her in
      giving an answer to Mr. Barclay's proposal, which she ought either to
      accept or decline, according as her own feelings and judgment should
      decide.&mdash;"If you wish to take time to decide, your father and I will
      make Mr. Barclay clearly understand that he is not to consider this as any
      encouragement; and as to the rest," added Mrs. Percy, "when you are sure
      that you mean right, and that you do right, you will not, my dear
      Caroline, I hope, be deterred from determining upon what is best for your
      own happiness, merely by the weak fear of what idle foolish people will
      say about an affair in which they have no concern."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline assured her mother that no such weak fear acted upon her mind;
      and that in any case where she had the least doubt whether she could like
      a person as a husband or not, she should certainly ask for time to
      consider, before she would give an answer; but that, with respect to Mr.
      Barclay, she had had sufficient opportunities of seeing and judging of him
      in the character of a lover, whilst he had been the admirer of Lady
      Angelica; that she fully appreciated his good qualities, and was grateful
      for his favourable opinion; but that she felt perfectly certain that she
      did not and could not love him; and therefore she desired, as soon as
      possible, to put him out of the pain of suspense, to prevent him from
      having the mortification of showing himself the admirer of one by whom he
      must ultimately be refused; and to leave him at liberty to turn his
      thoughts elsewhere, to some person to whom he was better suited, and who
      was better suited to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barclay had made Mrs. Hungerford alone his confidant. As to Lady
      Angelica Headingham, he thought that her ladyship could not be in any
      doubt of the state of his affections as far as she was concerned, and that
      was all she had a right to know. He never had actually declared his
      passion for her, and his attentions had completely ceased since the
      determination she had made to break her engagement with his aunt; but Lady
      Angelica had still imagined that he would not be able to bring himself to
      part with her for ever, and she trusted that, even at the moment of
      getting into her carriage, she might prevail upon him to forget his
      wrongs, and might at last carry him off. These hopes had been checked, and
      for a moment overthrown, by Mr. Barclay's appearance this morning in the
      Oriel; the emotion with which she saw him speak to Caroline, and the
      indifference with which she heard him wish her ladyship health and
      happiness at Weymouth, or wherever she went, for an instant convinced her
      of the truth. But obstinate vanity recurred to the hope that he was not
      yet irreclaimable, and under this persuasion she hurried on the
      preparations for her departure, impatient for the moment of crisis&mdash;of
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment of crisis arrived&mdash;but not of triumph. Lady Angelica
      Headingham's landau came to the door. But <i>trunks packed and corded</i>
      gave no pang to her former lover&mdash;Mrs. Hungerford did not press her
      to stay&mdash;Mr. Barclay handed her into the carriage&mdash;she stooped
      to conquer, so far as to tell him that, as she had only Mr. Seebright and
      her maid, she could give him a seat in her carriage, if he would come to
      Weymouth, and that she would thence, in a fortnight at farthest, go to his
      aunt, dear Lady B&mdash;&mdash;, in Leicestershire. But all in vain&mdash;she
      saw it would not do&mdash;bid her servant shut the carriage-door&mdash;desired
      Mr. Seebright to draw up the glass, and, with a look of angry contempt
      towards Mr. Barclay, threw herself back on the seat to conceal the
      vexation which she could not control, and drove away for ever from
      irreclaimable lovers and lost friends. We do not envy Mr. Seebright his
      trip to Weymouth with his patroness in this humour; but without troubling
      ourselves further to inquire what became of her, we leave her
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "To flaunt, and go down a disregarded thing."
</pre>
    <p>
      Rosamond seemed to think that if Caroline married Mr. Barclay, the
      dénouement would be too near, too clear, and commonplace: she said that in
      this case Caroline would just be married, like any body else, to a man
      with a good fortune, good character, good sense, and every thing very
      good, but nothing extraordinary, and she would be settled at Mr. Barclay's
      seat in Leicestershire, and she would be Mrs. Barclay, and, perhaps, happy
      enough, but nothing extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plain view of things, and this positive termination of all hope of
      romance, did not please Rosamond's imagination. She was relieved, when at
      last Caroline surprised her with the assurance that there was no
      probability of Mr. Barclay's succeeding in his suit. "And yet," said
      Caroline, "if I were compelled at this moment to marry, of all men I have
      ever yet seen, Mr. Barclay is the person to whom I could engage myself
      with the least reluctance&mdash;the person with whom I think I should have
      the best security for happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond's face again lengthened. "If that is the case," said she, "though
      you have no intention of marrying him at present, you will, I suppose, be
      <i>reasoned into</i> marrying him in time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Caroline, "for I cannot be reasoned into loving him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's my own dear Caroline," cried Rosamond: "I was horribly afraid
      that this man of sense would have convinced you that esteem was quite
      sufficient without love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!" said Caroline. "There must be some very powerful motive that
      could induce me to quit my family: I can conceive no motive sufficiently
      powerful, except love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond was delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what else <i>could</i> I marry?" continued Caroline: "I, who am left
      by the kindest of parents freely to my own choice&mdash;could I marry for
      a house in Leicestershire? or for a barouche and four? on Lady Jane
      Granville's principles for <i>an establishment</i>? or on the <i>missy</i>
      notion of being married, and having a house of my own, and ordering my own
      dinner?&mdash;Was this your notion of me?" said Caroline, with a look of
      such surprise, that Rosamond was obliged to fall immediately to
      protestations, and appeals to common sense. "How was it possible she could
      have formed such ideas!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why were you so much surprised and transported just now, when I told
      you that no motive but love could induce me to marry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't recollect being surprised&mdash;I was only delighted. I never
      suspected that you could marry without love, but I thought that you and I
      might differ as to the quantity&mdash;the degree."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No common degree of love, and no common love, would be sufficient to
      induce me to marry," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once, and but once, before in your life, you gave me the idea of your
      having such an exalted opinion of love," replied Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But to return to Mr. Barclay," said Caroline. "I have, as I promised my
      father that I would, consulted in the first place my own heart, and
      considered my own happiness. He appears to me incapable of that enthusiasm
      which rises either to the moral or intellectual sublime. I respect his
      understanding, and esteem his principles; but in conversing with him, I
      always feel&mdash;and in passing my life with him, how much more should I
      feel!&mdash;that there is a want of the higher qualities of the mind. He
      shows no invention, no genius, no magnanimity&mdash;nothing heroic,
      nothing great, nothing which could waken sympathy, or excite that strong
      attachment, which I think that I am capable of feeling for a superior
      character&mdash;for a character at once good and great."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where upon earth are you to find such a man? Who is romantic now?"
      cried Rosamond. "But I am very glad that you <i>are</i> a little romantic;
      I am glad that you have in you a touch of human absurdity, else how could
      you be my sister, or how could I love you as I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am heartily glad that you love me, but I am not sensible of my present
      immediate claim to your love by my touch of human absurdity," said
      Caroline, smiling. "What did I say, that was absurd or romantic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, people never think their own romance absurd. Well! granted that
      you are not romantic, since that is a point which I find I must grant
      before we can go on,&mdash;now, tell me, was Mr. Barclay very sorry when
      you refused him?" said Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare not tell you that there is yet no danger of his breaking his
      heart," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I thought," cried Rosamond, with a look of ineffable contempt. "I
      thought he was not a man to break his heart for love. With all his sense,
      I dare say he will go back to his Lady Angelica Headingham. I should not
      be surprised if he went after her to Weymouth to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should," said Caroline; "especially as he has just ordered his carriage
      to take him to his aunt, Lady B&mdash;&mdash;, in Leicestershire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! poor man!" said Rosamond, "now I do pity him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he is going to his aunt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; Caroline&mdash;you are very cruel&mdash;because I am sure he is very
      much touched and disappointed by your refusal. He cannot bear to see you
      again. Poor! <i>poor</i> Mr. Barclay! I have been shamefully ill-natured.
      I hope I did not prejudice your mind against him&mdash;I'll go directly
      and take leave of him&mdash;poor Mr. Barclay!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond, however, returned a few minutes afterwards, to complain that Mr.
      Barclay had not made efforts enough to persuade Caroline to listen to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he had been warmly in love, he would not so easily have given up hope.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'None, without hope, e'er loved the brightest fair;
  But love can hope, where Reason should despair.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      "That, I think, is perfectly true," said Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never&mdash;begging Rosamond and the poet's pardon&mdash;never&mdash;except
      where reason is very weak, or where the brightest fair has some touch of
      the equivocating fiend. Love, let poets and lovers say what they will to
      the contrary, can no more subsist without hope than flame can exist
      without fuel. In all the cases cited to prove the contrary, we suspect
      that there has been some inaccuracy in the experiment, and that by mistake
      a little, a very little hope has been admitted. The slightest portion, a
      quantity imperceptible to common observation, is known to be quite
      sufficient to maintain the passion; but a total exclusion of hope secures
      its extinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barclay's departure was much regretted by all at Hungerford Castle,
      most, perhaps, by the person who expressed that regret the least, Lady
      Mary Pembroke&mdash;who now silently enjoyed the full chorus of praise
      that was poured forth in honour of the departed. Lady Mary's common mode
      of enjoying the praise of her friends was not in silence; all she thought
      and felt usually came to her lips with the ingenuous vivacity of youth and
      innocence. Caroline had managed so well by not managing at all, that Lady
      Mary, far from guessing the real cause of Mr. Barclay's sudden departure,
      repeatedly expressed surprise that her aunt Hungerford did not press him
      to stay a little longer; and once said she wondered how Mr. Barclay <i>could</i>
      leave Hungerford Castle whilst Caroline was there; that she had begun to
      think he had formed an attachment which would do him more honour than his
      passion for Lady Angelica Headingham, but that she feared he would have a
      relapse of that fit of folly, and that it would at last end fatally in
      marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hungerford smiled at the openness with which her niece told her
      conjectures, and at the steadiness with which Caroline kept Mr. Barclay's
      secret, by saying no more than just the thing she ought. "The power of
      keeping a secret is very different from the habit of dissimulation. You
      would convince me of this, if I had doubted it," said Mrs. Hungerford, to
      Caroline. "Now that the affair is settled, my dear, I must insist upon
      your praising me, as I have praised you for discretion. I hope I never
      influenced your decision by word or look, but I will now own to you that I
      was very anxious that you should decide precisely as you have done. Mr.
      Barclay is a sensible man, an excellent man, one who will make any amiable
      woman he marries happy. I am convinced of it, or I should not, as I do,
      wish to see him married to my niece&mdash;yet I never thought him suited
      to you. Yours is a character without pretension, yet one which, in love
      and marriage, would not, I believe, be easily satisfied, would require
      great qualities, a high tone of thought and action, a character superior
      and lofty as your own."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hungerford paused, and seemed lost in thought. Caroline felt that
      this lady had seen deeply into her mind. This conviction, beyond all
      praise, and all demonstrations of fondness, increases affection,
      confidence, and gratitude, in strong and generous minds. Caroline
      endeavoured, but could not well express in words what she felt at this
      instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," said Mrs. Hungerford, "we know that we are speaking plain truth
      to each other&mdash;we need no flowers of speech&mdash;I understand you,
      and you understand me. We are suited to each other&mdash;yes,
      notwithstanding the difference of age, and a thousand other differences,
      we are suited to each other. This possibility of a friendship between
      youth and age is one of the rewards Heaven grants to the early and late
      cultivation of the understanding and of the affections. Late as it is with
      me in life, I have not, thank God, survived my affections. How can I ever,
      whilst I have such children, such friends!" After a pause of a few moments
      of seemingly pleasurable reflections, Mrs. Hungerford continued, "I have
      never considered friendship as but a name&mdash;as a mere worldly commerce
      of interest: I believe in disinterested affection, taking the word <i>disinterested</i>
      in its proper sense; and I have still, believe me, the power of
      sympathizing with a <i>young</i> friend&mdash;such a young friend as
      Caroline Percy. Early as it is with her in life, she has so cultivated her
      understanding, so regulated her mind, that she cannot consider friendship
      merely as a companionship in frivolous amusement, or a mixture of
      gossiping confidences and idle sentiment; therefore, I am proud enough to
      hope that she can and will be the friend of such an old woman as I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be the pride of my life to have&mdash;to deserve such a friend,"
      cried Caroline: "I feel all the condescension of this kindness. I know you
      are much too good to me. I am afraid you think too highly of me. But Mrs.
      Hungerford's praise does not operate like flattery: though it exalts me in
      my own opinion, it shall not make me vain; it excites my ambition to be&mdash;all
      she thinks me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You <i>are</i> all I think you," said Mrs. Hungerford; "and that you may
      hereafter be something yet nearer than a friend to me is the warmest wish
      of my heart&mdash;But, no, I will not indulge myself in expressing that
      wish; Such wishes are never wise where we have no power, no right to act&mdash;such
      wishes often counteract their own object&mdash;anticipations are always
      imprudent. But&mdash;about my niece, Lady Mary Pembroke. I particularly
      admire the discretion, still more than the kindness, with which you have
      acted with respect to her and Mr. Barclay&mdash;you have left things to
      their natural course. You have not by any imprudent zeal or generosity
      hazarded a word that could hurt the delicacy of either party. You seem to
      have been fully aware that wherever the affections are concerned, the
      human mind is most tenacious of what one half of the philosophers in the
      world will not allow to exist, and the other half cannot define.
      Influenced as we all are every moment in our preferences and aversions,
      sometimes imperceptibly, sometimes avowedly, by the most trifling and
      often the silliest causes, yet the wisest of us start, and back, and think
      it incumbent on our pride in love affairs, to resist the slightest
      interference, or the best advice, from the best friends. What! love upon
      compulsion! No&mdash;Jupiter is not more tenacious of his thunderbolt than
      Cupid is of his arrows. Blind as he is, none may presume to direct the
      hand of that little urchin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a servant, who
      brought the post-bag, with many letters for Mrs. Hungerford.

      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The arrival of the post was at this time an anxious moment to Mrs.
      Hungerford, as she had so many near relations and friends in the army and
      navy. This day brought letters, with news that lighted up her countenance
      with dignified joy, one from Captain Hungerford, her second son, ten
      minutes after an action at sea with the French.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear mother&mdash;English victorious, of course; for particulars, see
      Gazette. In the cockle shell I have, could do nothing worth mentioning,
      but am promised a ship soon, and hope for opportunity to show myself
      worthy to be your son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "F. HUNGERFORD."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope I am grateful to Providence for such children!" cried Mrs.
      Hungerford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mortimer darted upon Captain Hungerford's name in the Gazette&mdash;"And
      I cannot refrain from mentioning to your lordships the gallant manner in
      which I was seconded by Captain Hungerford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happy mother that I am! And more happiness still&mdash;a letter also from
      my colonel! Thanks of commanding officer&mdash;gallant conduct abroad&mdash;leave
      of absence for three weeks&mdash;and will be here to-morrow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This news spread through the castle in a few minutes, and the whole house
      was in motion and in joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter?" said Rosamond, who had been out of the room when the
      colonel's letter was read. "As I came down stairs, I met I can't tell how
      many servants running different ways, with faces of delight. I do believe
      Colonel Hungerford is come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not come, but coming," said Mrs. Hungerford; "and I am proud that you, my
      friends, should see what a sensation the first sound of his return makes
      in his own <i>home</i>. There it is, after all, that you may best judge
      what a man really is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Every thing conspired to give Caroline a favourable idea of Colonel
      Hungerford. He arrived&mdash;and his own appearance and manners, far from
      contradicting, fully justified all that his friends had said. His
      appearance was that of a soldier and a gentleman, with a fine person and
      striking countenance, with the air of command, yet without presumption;
      not without a consciousness of his own merit, but apparently with only a
      consciousness sufficient to give value and grace to his deference for
      others. To those he respected or loved, his manner was particularly
      engaging; and the appropriate attentions he paid to each of his friends
      proved that their peculiar tastes, their characteristic merits, and their
      past kindnesses, were ever full in his remembrance. To his mother his
      grateful affection, and the tender reverence he showed, were quite
      touching; and the high opinion he had of her character, and the strong
      influence she held over his mind, he seemed proud to avow in words and
      actions. To his sister Mortimer, in a different but not less pleasing
      manner, his affection appeared in a thousand little instances, which the
      most polite courtiers, with the most officious desire to please, could not
      without the happy inspiration of truth have invented. There were
      innumerable slight strokes in his conversation with his sister which
      marked the pleasure he felt in the recollection of their early friendship,
      allusions to trivial passages in the history of their childhood, which
      none of the important scenes in which he had since been engaged had
      effaced from his mind; and at other times a playful carelessness, that
      showed the lightness, the expanding freedom of heart, which can be felt
      only in the perfect confidence and intimacy of domestic affection. In his
      manner towards his cousins, the Lady Pembrokes, who, since he had last
      seen them, had grown up from children into fine young women, there were
      nice differences; with all the privileged familiarity of relationship he
      met the sprightly frankness of Lady Mary, and by a degree of delicate
      tender respect put the retiring sensitive timidity of Lady Elizabeth at
      ease. None of these shades of manner were lost upon Caroline's
      discriminating observation. For some time after his arrival, the whole
      attention of every individual at Hungerford Castle was occupied by Colonel
      Hungerford. All were alternately talking of him or listening to him. The
      eagerness which every body felt to hear from him accounts of public and
      private affairs, and the multitude and variety of questions by which he
      was assailed, drew him out continually; so that he talked a great deal,
      yet evidently more to gratify others than himself. He was always unwilling
      to engross the conversation, and sometimes anxious to hear from his mother
      and sister of domestic occurrences; but he postponed his own
      gratification, and never failed to satisfy general curiosity, even by the
      repetition of narratives and anecdotes, till he was exhausted. Conscious
      that he did not wish to make himself the hero of his tale, he threw
      himself upon the mercy of his friends, or their justice; and without any
      of the provoking reserve of affected or cowardly humility, he talked
      naturally of the events in which he had taken a share, and of what
      concerned himself as well as others. With polite kindness, which gratified
      them peculiarly, he seemed to take the Percy family, as his mother's
      friends, directly upon trust as his own: he spoke before them, freely, of
      all his confidential opinions of men and things. He did them justice in
      considering them as safe auditors, and they enjoyed and fully appreciated
      the value of his various conversation. In his anecdotes of persons, there
      was always something decidedly characteristic of the individual, or
      illustrative of some general principle. In his narratives there were
      strong marks of the Froissart accuracy of detail, which interests by
      giving the impression of reality, and the proof of having been an
      eye-witness of the scene; and sometimes, scorning detail, he displayed the
      power of keeping an infinite number of particulars in subordination, and
      of seizing those large features which gave a rapid and masterly view of
      the whole. For his profession he felt that enthusiasm which commands
      sympathy. Whilst he spoke of the British army, those who heard him seemed
      to see every thing, as he did, in a military point of view. Yet his love
      of military glory had not hardened his heart so as to render him
      insensible of the evils and sufferings which, alas! it necessarily
      produces. The natural expression of great feeling and humanity burst from
      him; but he turned hastily and firmly from the contemplation of evils,
      which he could not prevent, and would not uselessly deplore. In conversing
      one day privately with Mr. Percy, he showed that bitter and deep
      philosophic reflections on the horrors and folly of war had passed through
      his mind, but that he had systematically and resolutely shut them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are now," said he, "less likely than ever to see the time when all the
      princes of Europe will sign the good Abbé de St. Pierre's project for a
      perpetual peace; and, in the mean time, while kingdoms can maintain their
      independence, their existence, only by superiority in war, it is not for
      the defenders of their country to fix their thoughts upon 'the price of
      victory.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      After explaining the plan of a battle, or the intrigues of a court,
      Colonel Hungerford would turn with delight to plans of cottages, which his
      sister Mortimer was drawing for him; and from a map of the seat of war he
      would go to a map of his own estate, eagerly asking his mother where she
      would recommend that houses should be built, and consulting her about the
      characters and merits of those tenants with whom his absence on the
      continent had prevented him from becoming acquainted. These and a thousand
      other little traits showed that his military habits had not destroyed his
      domestic tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline had taken an interest in the military profession ever since her
      eldest brother had gone into the army. Colonel Hungerford was seven or
      eight years older than Godfrey Percy, and had a more formed, steady, and
      exalted character, with more knowledge, and a far more cultivated
      understanding; but many expressions, and some points of character, were
      similar. Caroline observed this, and wished and hoped that, when her
      brother should have had as many opportunities of improvement as Colonel
      Hungerford's experience had given him, he might be just such a man. This
      idea increased the interest she took in observing and listening to Colonel
      Hungerford. After he had been some time at home, and that every day more
      and more of his amiable character had been developed, Rosamond said to
      herself, "This is certainly the man for Caroline, and I suspect she begins
      to think so. If she does not, I never will forgive her."
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when the sisters were by themselves, Rosamond tried to sound
      Caroline on this subject. She began, as she thought, at a safe distance
      from her main object. "How very much esteemed and beloved Colonel
      Hungerford is in his own family!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much and very deservedly," answered Caroline. She spoke without any
      hesitation or embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond, rather dissatisfied even with the fulness of the assent to her
      first proposition, added, "And not only by his own family, but by all who
      know him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is surprising," continued Rosamond, "that a man who has led a
      soldier's wandering life should have acquired so much literature, such
      accurate knowledge, and should have retained such simple and domestic
      tastes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Full assent again from Caroline, both of look and voice&mdash;but still
      not the exact look and voice Rosamond desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, Caroline," continued she, "I think that in several things
      Colonel Hungerford is very like my brother Godfrey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and in some points, I think Colonel Hungerford is superior to
      Godfrey," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I really think so too," cried Rosamond, "and I am sure Godfrey
      would think and say so himself. How he would admire Colonel Hungerford,
      and how desirous, how ambitious he would be to make such a man his friend,
      his&mdash;in short, I know if Godfrey was here this minute, he would think
      just as I do about Colonel Hungerford, and about&mdash;all other things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All other things," repeated Caroline, smiling: "that includes a great
      deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it does, that is certain," said Rosamond, significantly. "And,"
      continued she, "I know another person of excellent judgment too, who, if I
      mistake not, is of my way of thinking, of wishing at least, in <i>some
      things</i>, that is a comfort. How Mrs. Hungerford does adore her son! And
      I think she loves you almost as much." Caroline expressed strong gratitude
      for Mrs. Hungerford's kindness to her, and the warmest return of
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, in one word," continued Rosamond, "for out it must come, sooner or
      later&mdash;I think she not only loves you as if you were her daughter,
      but that&mdash;Now confess, Caroline, did not the idea ever occur to you?
      And don't you see that Mrs. Hungerford wishes <i>it</i>?&mdash;Oh! that
      blush is answer enough&mdash;I'll say no more&mdash;I do not mean to
      torment or distress&mdash;good bye, I am satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, my dear Rosamond, stay one moment, and I will tell you exactly all
      I think and feel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will stay as long as you please," said Rosamond, "and I thank you for
      this confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a right to it," said Caroline: "I see, my dear sister, and feel
      all your kindness towards me, and all Mrs. Hungerford's&mdash;I see what
      you both wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's my own sister Caroline, above all artifice and affectation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>But</i>&mdash;Oh! Caroline, don't go back&mdash;don't palter with us&mdash;abide
      by your own words, and your own character, and don't condescend to any
      pitiful <i>buts</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not yet know the nature of my <i>but</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor do I wish to know it, nor will I hear it," cried Rosamond, stopping
      her ears, "because I know, whatever it is, it will lower you in my
      opinion. You have fairly acknowledged that Colonel Hungerford possesses
      every virtue, public and private, that can make him worthy of you&mdash;not
      a single fault on which to ground one possible, imaginable, rational <i>but</i>.
      Temper, manners, talents, character, fortune, family, fame, every thing
      the heart of woman can desire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every thing against which the heart of woman should guard itself," said
      Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guard!&mdash;Why guard?&mdash;What is it you suspect? What crime can you
      invent to lay to his charge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspect him of nothing. It is no crime&mdash;except, perhaps, in your
      eyes, dear Rosamond," said Caroline, smiling&mdash;"no crime not to love
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! is that all? Now I understand and forgive you," said Rosamond, "if it
      is only <i>that</i> you fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not recollect that I said I <i>feared</i> it," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well&mdash;I beg pardon for using that unguarded word&mdash;of
      course your pride must neither hope nor fear upon the occasion; you must
      quite forget yourself to stone. As you please, or rather as you think
      proper; but you will allow me to hope and fear for you. Since I have not,
      thank Heaven! made proud and vain professions of stoicism&mdash;have not
      vowed to throw away the rose, lest I should be pricked by the thorn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Laugh, but hear me," said Caroline. "I make no professions of stoicism;
      it is because I am conscious that I am no stoic that I have endeavoured to
      guard well my heart.&mdash;I have seen and admired all Colonel
      Hungerford's good and amiable qualities; I have seen and been grateful for
      all that you and Mrs. Hungerford hoped and wished for my happiness&mdash;have
      not been insensible to any of the delightful, any of the romantic
      circumstances of the <i>vision</i>; but I saw it was only a vision&mdash;and
      one that might lead me into waking, lasting misery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Misery! lasting! How?" said Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither your wishes nor Mrs. Hungerford's, you know, can or ought to
      decide, or even to influence the event, that is to be determined by
      Colonel Hungerford's own judgment and feelings, and by mine. In the mean
      time, I cannot forget that the delicacy, honour, pride, prudence of our
      sex, forbid a woman to think of any man, as a lover, till he gives her
      reason to believe that he feels love for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Rosamond; "but I take it for granted that Colonel
      Hungerford does love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should we take it for granted?" said Caroline: "he has not shown
      me any preference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;I don't know, I am not skilled in these matters," said Rosamond&mdash;"I
      am not sure&mdash;but I think&mdash;and yet I should be sorry to mislead
      you&mdash;at any rate there is no harm in hoping&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there be no harm, there might be much danger," said Caroline: "better
      not to think of the subject at all, since we can do no good by thinking of
      it, and may do harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause of surprise, disappointment, and reflection, Rosamond
      resumed: "So I am to understand it to be your opinion, that a woman of
      sense, delicacy, proper pride, honour, and prudence, must, can, and ought
      to shut her eyes, ears, understanding, and heart, against all the merit
      and all the powers of pleasing a man may possess, till said man shall and
      do make a matrimonial proposal for her in due form&mdash;hey! Caroline?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never thought any such thing," answered Caroline, "and I expressed
      myself very ill if I said any such thing. A woman need not shut her eyes,
      ears, or understanding to a man's merit&mdash;only her heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the irresistible charm, the supreme merit, the only merit that can
      or ought to touch her heart in any man, is the simple or glorious
      circumstance of his loving her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard that it was a man's supreme merit to love," said Caroline;
      "but we are not at present inquiring what is a man's but what is a woman's
      characteristic excellence. And I have heard it said to be a woman's
      supreme merit, and grace, and dignity, that her love should <i>not
      unsought be won</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true," said Rosamond, "perfectly true&mdash;in general; but
      surely you will allow that there may be cases in which it would be
      difficult to adhere to the letter as well as to the spirit of this
      excellent rule. Have you never felt&mdash;can't you imagine this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can well imagine it," said Caroline; "fortunately, I have never felt
      it. If I had not early perceived that Colonel Hungerford was not thinking
      of me, I might have deceived myself with false hopes: believe me, I never
      was insensible to his merit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where is the merit or the glory, if there was no struggle, no
      difficulty?" said Rosamond, in a melancholy tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glory there is none," said Caroline; "nor do I claim any merit: but is
      not it something to prevent struggle and difficulty? Is it nothing to
      preserve my own happiness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something, to be sure," said Rosamond. "But, on the other hand, you know
      there is the old proverb, 'Nothing hazard, nothing have.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a masculine, not a feminine proverb," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I meant to say was, that there is no rule without an exception, as
      all your philosophers, even the most rigid, allow; and if an exception be
      ever permitted, surely in such a case as this it might, in favour of such
      a man as Colonel Hungerford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dangerous exceptions!" said Caroline. "Every body is too apt to make an
      exception in such cases in their own favour: that, you know, is the common
      error of the weak. Oh! my dear sister, instead of weakening, strengthen my
      mind&mdash;instead of trying to raise my enthusiasm, or reproaching me for
      want of sensibility, tell me that you approve of my exerting all my power
      over myself to do that which I think right. Consider what evil I should
      bring upon myself, if I became attached to a man who is not attached to
      me; if you saw me sinking, an object of pity and contempt, the victim, the
      slave of an unhappy passion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! my dear, dear Caroline, that could never be&mdash;God forbid; oh! God
      forbid!" cried Rosamond, with a look of terror: but recovering herself,
      she added, "This is a vain fear. With your strength of mind, you could
      never be reduced to such a condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can answer for their strength of mind in the second trial, if it fail
      in the first?" said Caroline. "If a woman once lets her affections go out
      of her power, how can she afterwards answer for her own happiness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All very right and very true," said Rosamond: "but for a young person,
      Caroline, I could spare some of this premature reason. If there be some
      folly, at least there is some generosity, some sensibility often joined
      with a romantic temper: take care lest you 'mistake reverse of wrong for
      right,' and in your great zeal to avoid romance, run into selfishness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Selfishness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes&mdash;after all, what are these cold calculations about loving
      or not loving such a character as Colonel Hungerford&mdash;what is all
      this wonderfully long-sighted care of your own individual happiness, but
      selfishness?&mdash;moral, very moral selfishness, I grant."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline coloured, paused, and when she answered, she spoke in a lower and
      graver tone and manner than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it be selfish to pursue, by the best means in my power, and by means
      which cannot hurt any human being, my own happiness, must I deserve to be
      called selfish?&mdash;Unless a woman be quite unconnected with others in
      society, without a family, and without friends&mdash;which, I thank God,
      is not my situation&mdash;it is impossible to hazard or to destroy our own
      happiness by any kind of imprudence, without destroying the happiness of
      others. Therefore imprudence, call it romance, or what you please, is
      often want of generosity&mdash;want of thought for the happiness of our
      friends, as well as for our own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well come off!" said Rosamond, laughing: "you have proved, with admirable
      logic, that prudence is the height of generosity. But, my dear Caroline,
      do not speak so very seriously, and do not look with such 'sweet austere
      composure.'&mdash;I don't in earnest accuse you of selfishness&mdash;I was
      wrong to use that ugly word; but I was vexed with you for being more
      prudent than even good old Mrs. Hungerford."
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words tears filled Caroline's eyes. "Dear, kind Mrs. Hungerford,"
      she exclaimed, "in the warmth of her heart, in the fulness of her kindness
      for me, once in her life Mrs. Hungerford said perhaps an imprudent word,
      expressed a wish of which her better judgment may have repented."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no!" cried Rosamond&mdash;"her better, her best judgment must have
      confirmed her opinion of you. She never will repent of that wish. Why
      should you think she has repented of it, Caroline?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because she must by this time see that there is no probability of that
      wish being accomplished: she must, therefore, desire that it should be
      forgotten. And I trust I have acted, and shall always act, as if it were
      forgotten by me, except as to its kindness&mdash;<i>that</i> I shall
      remember while I have life and feeling. But if I had built a romance upon
      that slight word, consider how much that excellent friend would blame
      herself, when she found that she had misled me, that she had been the
      cause of anguish to my heart, that she had lowered in the opinion of all,
      even in her own opinion, one she had once so exalted by her approbation
      and friendship. And, oh! consider, Rosamond, what a return should I make
      for that friendship, if I were to be the occasion of any misunderstanding,
      any disagreement between her and her darling son. If <i>I</i> were to
      become the rival of her beloved niece!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rival!&mdash;Niece!&mdash;How?&mdash;Which?" cried Rosamond, "Which?"
      repeated she, eagerly; "I cannot think of any thing else, till you say
      which."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose Lady Elizabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The thought never occurred to me&mdash;Is it possible?&mdash;My dear
      Caroline, you have opened my eyes&mdash;But are you sure? Then you have
      acted wisely, rightly, Caroline; and I have as usual been very, <i>very</i>
      imprudent. Forgive what I said about selfishness&mdash;I was unjust. You
      selfish! you, who thought of all your friends, I thought only of you. But
      tell me, did you think of Lady Elizabeth from the first? Did you see how
      it would be from the very first?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I never thought of it till lately, and I am not sure of it yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you never thought of it till lately, and you are not sure of it yet?&mdash;Then
      I dare say you are mistaken, and wrong, with all your superfluous
      prudence. I will observe with my own eyes, and trust only my own
      judgment."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this laudable resolution Rosamond departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning she had an opportunity of observing, and deciding by her
      own judgment. Lady Elizabeth Pembroke and Caroline had both been copying a
      picture of Prince Rupert when a boy. They had finished their copies. Mrs.
      Hungerford showed them to her son. Lady Elizabeth's was rather the
      superior painting. Colonel Hungerford instantly distinguished it, and, in
      strong terms, expressed his admiration; but, by some mistake, he fancied
      that both copies were done by Caroline: she explained to him that that
      which he preferred was Lady Elizabeth's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours!" exclaimed Colonel Hungerford, turning to Lady Elizabeth with a
      look and tone of delighted surprise. Lady Elizabeth coloured, Lady Mary
      smiled: he forbore adding one word either of praise or observation.
      Caroline gently relieved Mrs. Hungerford's hand from her copy of the
      picture which she still held.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond, breathless, looked and looked and waited for something more
      decisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother wished for a copy of this picture," said Lady Elizabeth, in a
      tremulous voice, and without raising her eyes, "for we have none but a
      vile daub of him at Pembroke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps my aunt Pembroke would be so good to accept of the original?"
      said Colonel Hungerford; "and my mother would beg of Lady Elizabeth to
      give her copy to&mdash;our gallery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do, my dear Elizabeth," said Mrs. Hungerford. Lady Elizabeth shook her
      head, yet smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do, my dear; you cannot refuse your cousin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Cousin!</i> there's hope still," thought Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it were but worthy of his acceptance," said Lady Elizabeth.&mdash;Colonel
      Hungerford, lost in the enjoyment of her self-timidity and retiring grace,
      quite forgot to say how much he thought the picture worthy of his
      acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother spoke for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since Hungerford asks you for it, my dear, you may be certain that he
      thinks highly of it, for my son never flatters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who? I!&mdash;flatter!" cried Colonel Hungerford; "flatter!" added he, in
      a low voice, with a tenderness of accent and look, which could scarcely be
      misunderstood. Nor was it misunderstood by Lady Elizabeth, as her quick
      varying colour showed. It was well that, at this moment, no eye turned
      upon Rosamond, for all her thoughts and feeling would have been read in
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come," cried Lady Mary, "let us have the picture in its place directly&mdash;come
      all of you to the gallery, fix where it shall be hung." Colonel Hungerford
      seized upon it, and following Lady Elizabeth, accompanied Lady Mary to the
      gallery. Mrs. Hungerford rose deliberately&mdash;Caroline offered her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear child, let me lean upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked slowly after the young party&mdash;Rosamond followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid," said Mrs. Hungerford, as she leaned more upon Caroline, "I
      am afraid I shall tire you, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! no, no!" said Caroline, "not in the least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am growing so infirm, that I require a stronger arm, a kinder I can
      never have."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the antechamber, which opened into the gallery, closed after
      the young people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not one of those <i>exigeante</i> mothers who expect always to have
      possession of a son's arm," resumed Mrs. Hungerford: "the time, I knew,
      would come, when I must give up my colonel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And with pleasure, I am sure, you now give him up, secure of his
      happiness," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hungerford stopped short, and looked full on Caroline, upon whom she
      had previously avoided to turn her eyes. From what anxiety did Caroline's
      serene, open countenance, and sweet ingenuous smile, at this instant,
      relieve her friend! Old as she was, Mrs. Hungerford had quick and strong
      feelings. For a moment she could not speak&mdash;she held out her arms to
      Caroline, and folded her to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent creature!" said she&mdash;"Child of my affections&mdash;<i>that</i>
      you must ever be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Mrs. Hungerford! my dear madam," cried Rosamond, "you have no idea
      how unjust and imprudent I have been about Caroline."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My love," said Mrs. Hungerford, smiling, and wiping tears from her eyes,
      "I fancy I can form a competent idea of your imprudence from my own. We
      must all learn discretion from this dear girl&mdash;you, early&mdash;I,
      late in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Rosamond, do not reproach yourself for your excessive kindness to
      me," said Caroline; "in candour and generous feeling, who is equal to
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kissing one another, I protest," cried Lady Mary Pembroke, opening the
      door from the gallery, "whilst we were wondering you did not come after
      us. Aunt Hungerford, you know how we looked for the bow and arrows, and
      the peaked shoes, with the knee-chains of the time of Edward the Fourth.
      Well, they are all behind the great armoury press, which Gustavus has been
      moving to make room for Elizabeth's copy of Prince Rupert. Do come and
      look at them&mdash;but stay, first I have a favour to beg of you,
      Caroline. I know Gustavus will ask my sister to ride with him this
      morning, and the flies torment her horse so, and she is such a coward,
      that she will not be able to listen to a word that is said to her&mdash;could
      you lend her your pretty gentle White Surrey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With pleasure," said Caroline, "and my net."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go and bring it to your ladyship," said Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My ladyship is in no hurry," cried Lady Mary&mdash;"don't run away, don't
      go: it is not wanted yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rosamond, glad to escape, ran away, saying, "There is some of the
      fringe off&mdash;I must sew it on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond, as she sewed on the fringe, sighed&mdash;and worked&mdash;and
      wished it was for Caroline, and said to herself, "So it is all over&mdash;and
      all in vain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses for the happy riding party came to the door. Rosamond ran down
      stairs with the net; Caroline had it put on her horse, and Lady Elizabeth
      Pembroke thanked her with such a look of kindness, of secure faith in her
      friend's sympathy, that even Rosamond forgave her for being happy. But
      Rosamond could not wish to stay to witness her happiness just at this
      time; and she was not sorry when her father announced the next day that
      business required his immediate return home. Lamentations, loud and
      sincere, were heard from every individual in the castle, especially from
      Mrs. Hungerford, and from her daughter. They were, however, too well bred
      to persist in their solicitations to have the visit prolonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said they were grateful for the time which had been given to them,
      and appeared kindly satisfied with their friends' promise to repeat their
      visit, whenever they could with convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline, tenderly and gratefully attached to Mrs. Hungerford, found it
      very difficult and painful to part from her; the more painful because she
      feared to express all the affection, admiration, and gratitude she felt
      for this excellent friend, lest her emotion might be misinterpreted. Mrs.
      Hungerford understood her thoroughly. When she took leave of her, she
      kissed her at first in silence, and then, by a few strong words, and more
      by her manner than by her words, expressed her high esteem and affection
      for her young friend.

      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      LETTER FROM DR. PERCY TO HIS SISTER ROSAMOND.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never told you, my dear Rosamond, that the beautiful Constance was Mr.
      Gresham's daughter; I told you only that I saw her at his house. To the
      best of my belief she is no relation to him. She is daughter to Mr.
      Gresham's sick partner; and this partner&mdash;now, Rosamond, here is
      coincidence, if not romance, enough to please you&mdash;this partner is
      Mr. Panton, the London correspondent of the shipwrecked Dutch merchants,
      the very Panton and Co. to whom my father lately wrote to recommend
      Godfrey's friend, young Captain Henry&mdash;captain no more. I have not
      seen him yet; he is invisible, in the counting-house, in the remote city,
      in ultimate Broad-street, far as pole from pole from me at <i>Mrs.</i>
      Panton's fine house in Grosvenor-square.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But now to have done with an old story, before I begin with a new&mdash;I
      will tell you at once all I know, or probably shall ever know, about
      Constance. She is sole heiress to her father's fortune, which, on his
      repeated word, I believe, amounts to hundreds of thousands. She is
      accomplished and amiable, and, as I told you before, beautiful: but
      luckily her style of beauty, which is that of one of Rubens' wives, does
      not particularly strike my fancy. Besides, I would really and truly rather
      have a profession than be an idle gentleman: I love my profession, and
      feel ambitious to distinguish myself in it, and to make you all proud of
      your brother, Dr. Percy. These general principles are strengthened beyond
      the possibility of doubt, by the particular circumstances of <i>the
      present case</i>. A young unknown physician, I have been introduced by a
      friend to this family, and have, in my medical capacity, been admitted to
      a degree of familiarity in the house which none shall ever have cause to
      repent. Physicians, I think, are called upon for scrupulous <i>good faith</i>,
      because in some respects, they are more trusted in families, and have more
      opportunities of intimacy, than those of any other profession. I know, my
      dear Rosamond, you will not suspect me of assuming fine sentiments that
      are foreign to my real feelings; but I must now inform you, that if I
      could make myself agreeable and acceptable to Miss Panton, and if it were
      equally in my will and in my power, yet I should never be, in the language
      of the market, one shilling the better for her. Her father, a man of low
      birth, and having, perhaps, in spite of his wealth, suffered from the
      proud man's contumely, has determined to ennoble his family by means of
      his only child, and she is not to enjoy his fortune unless she marry one
      who has a title. If she unites herself with any man, below the rank of a
      baron's son, he swears she shall never see the colour of sixpence of his
      money. I understand that a certain Lord Roadster, eldest son of Lord
      Runnymede, is the present candidate for her favour&mdash;or rather for her
      wealth; and that his lordship is <i>patronized</i> by her father. Every
      thing that could be done by the vulgar selfishness and moneyed pride of
      her father and mother-in-law to spoil this young lady, and to make her
      consider herself as the first and only object of consequence in this
      world, has been done&mdash;and yet she is not in the least spoiled. Shame
      to all systems of education! there are some natures so good, that they
      will go right, where all about them go wrong. My father will not admit
      this, and will exclaim, Nonsense!&mdash;I will try to say something that
      he will allow to be sense. Miss Panton's own mother was of a good family,
      and, I am told, was an amiable woman, of agreeable manners, and a
      cultivated mind, who had been sacrificed for fortune to this rich city
      husband. Her daughter's first principles and ideas of manners and morals
      were, I suppose, formed by her precepts and example. After her mother's
      death, I know she had the advantage of an excellent and enlightened friend
      in her father's partner, Mr. Gresham, who, having no children of his own,
      took pleasure, at all his leisure moments, in improving little Constance.
      Then the contrast between her father and him, between their ignorance and
      his enlightened liberality, must have early struck her mind, and thus, I
      suppose, by observing their faults and follies, she learned to form for
      herself an opposite character and manners. The present Mrs. Panton is only
      her step-mother. Mrs. Panton is a huge, protuberant woman, with a
      full-blown face, a bay wig, and artificial flowers; talking in an affected
      little voice, when she is in company, and when she has on her <i>company
      clothes and manners</i>; but bawling loud, in a vulgarly broad cockney
      dialect, when she is at her ease in her own house. She has an inordinate
      passion for dress, and a <i>rage</i> for fine people. I have a chance of
      becoming a favourite, because I am 'of a good <i>fammully</i>," and Mrs.
      Panton says she knows very well I have been egg and bird in the best
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My patient&mdash;observe, my patient is the last person of whom I speak
      or think&mdash;is nervous and hypochondriac; but as I do not believe that
      you have much taste for medical detail, I shall not trouble you with the
      particulars of this old gentleman's case, but pray for his recovery&mdash;for
      if I succeed in setting him up again, it will set me up.... For the first
      time I have, this day, after many calls, seen Godfrey's friend, young Mr.
      Henry. He is handsome, and, as you ladies say, <i>interesting</i>. He is
      particularly gentlemanlike in his manners; but he looks unhappy, and I
      thought he was reserved towards me; but I have no right yet to expect that
      he should be otherwise. He spoke of Godfrey with strong affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours, truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "ERASMUS PERCY."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the care of Mr. Panton's health, Dr. Percy was now the immediate
      successor to a certain apothecary of the name of Coxeater, who, by right
      of flattery, had reigned for many years over the family with arbitrary
      sway, till he offended the lady of the house by agreeing with her husband
      upon some disputed point about a julep. The apothecary had a terrible loss
      of old Panton, for he swallowed more drugs in the course of a week than
      any man in the city swallows in a year. At the same time, he was so
      economical of these very drugs, that when Dr. Percy ordered the removal
      from his bedchamber of a range of half full phials, he was actually near
      crying at the thoughts of the waste of such a quantity of good physic: he
      finished by turning away a footman for laughing at his ridiculous
      distress. Panton was obstinate by fits, but touch his fears about his
      health, and he would be as docile as the <i>bon vivant</i> seigneur in
      Zadig, whose physician had no credit with him when he digested well, but
      who governed him despotically whenever he had an indigestion; so that he
      was ready to take any thing that could be prescribed, even a basilisk
      stewed in rose-water. This merchant, retired from business, was now as
      much engrossed with his health as ever he had been with his wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Percy was first called in, he found his patient in a lamentable
      state, in an arm-chair, dying with the apprehension of having swallowed in
      a peach a live earwig, which he was persuaded had bred, was breeding, or
      would breed in his stomach. However ridiculous this fancy may appear, it
      had taken such hold of the man, that he was really wasting away&mdash;his
      appetite failing as well as his spirits. He would not take the least
      exercise, or stir from his chair, scarcely move or permit himself to be
      moved, hand, foot, or head, lest he should disturb or waken this nest of
      earwigs. Whilst these "<i>reptiles</i>" slept, he said, he had rest; but
      when they wakened, he felt them crawling about and pinching his
      intestines. The wife had laughed, and the apothecary had flattered in
      vain: Panton angrily persisted in the assertion that he should die&mdash;and
      then they'd "see who was right." Dr. Percy recollected a case, which he
      had heard from a celebrated physician, of a hypochondriac, who fancied
      that his intestines were sealed up by a piece of wax which he had
      swallowed, and who, in this belief, refused to eat or drink any thing.
      Instead of fighting against the fancy, the judicious physician humoured it&mdash;showed
      the patient sealing-wax dissolving in spirit of wine, and then persuaded
      him to take some of that spirit to produce the same effect. The patient
      acceded to the reasoning, took the remedy, said that he felt that his
      intestines were unsealing&mdash;were unsealed: but, alas! they had been
      sealed so long, that they had lost their natural powers and actions, and
      he died lamenting that his excellent physician had not been called in soon
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Percy was more fortunate, for he came in time to kill the earwigs for
      his patient before they had pinched him to death. Erasmus showed Mr.
      Panton the experiment of killing one of these insects, by placing it
      within a magic circle of oil, and prevailed upon him to destroy his
      diminutive enemies with castor oil. When this <i>hallucination</i>, to
      speak in words of learned length, when this hallucination was removed,
      there was a still more difficult task, to cure our hypochondriac of the
      three remote causes of his disease&mdash;idleness of mind&mdash;indolence
      of body&mdash;and the habit of drinking every day a bottle of <i>London
      particular</i>: to prevail upon him to diminish the quantity per diem was
      deemed impossible by his wife; especially as Mr. Coxeater, the apothecary,
      had flattered him with the notion, that <i>to live high</i> was necessary
      for a gouty constitution, and that he was gouty.&mdash;N.B. He never had
      the gout in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Panton augured ill of Dr. Percy's success, and Constance grew pale
      when he touched upon this dangerous subject&mdash;the madeira. Yet he had
      hopes. He recollected the ingenious manner in which Dr. Brown [Footnote:
      Vide Life of Dr. Brown.] worked upon a Highland chieftain, to induce him
      to diminish his diurnal quantity of <i>spirituous potation</i>. But there
      was no family pride to work upon, at least no family arms were to be had.
      Erasmus found a succedaneum, however, in the love of titles and of what
      are called <i>fine people</i>. Lord Runnymede had given Mr. Panton a gold
      beaker, of curious workmanship, on which his lordship's arms were
      engraved; of this present the citizen was very fond and vain: observing
      this, Dr. Percy was determined to render it subservient to his purposes.
      He knew they would be right glad of any opportunity of producing and
      talking of this beaker to all their acquaintance. He therefore advised&mdash;no,
      not <i>advised</i>; for with some minds if you <i>advise</i> you are not
      listened to, if you command you are obeyed&mdash;he commanded that his
      patient should have his madeira always decanted into the curious beaker,
      for certain galvanic advantages that every knowing porter-drinker is aware
      of: Erasmus emptied a decanter of madeira into the beaker to show that it
      held more than a quart. This last circumstance decided Mr. Panton to give
      a solemn promise to abide by the advice of his physician, who seized this
      auspicious moment to act upon the imagination of his patient, by various
      medical anecdotes. Mr. Panton seemed to be much struck with the account of
      bottles made of antimonial glass, which continue, for years, to impregnate
      successive quantities of liquor with the same antimonial virtues. Dr.
      Percy then produced a piece of coloured crystal about the size of a large
      nut, which he directed his patient to put into the beaker, and to add
      another of these medicated crystals every day, till the vessel should be
      half full, to increase the power of the drug by successive additions; and
      by this arrangement, Panton was gradually reduced to half his usual
      quantity of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Percy's next difficulty was how to supply the purse-full and
      purse-proud citizen with motive and occupation. Mr. Panton had an utter
      aversion and contempt for all science and literature; he could not
      conceive that any man "could sit down to read for amusement," but he
      enjoyed a party of pleasure in a good boat on the water, to one of the <i>aits</i>
      or islets in the Thames at the right season, to be regaled with eel-pie.
      One book he had read, and one play he liked&mdash;no, not a play, but a
      pantomime. The book was Robinson Crusoe&mdash;the pantomime, Harlequin
      Friday. He had been heard to say, that if ever he had a villa, there
      should be in it an island like Robinson Crusoe's; and why not a fortress,
      a castle, and a grotto? this would be something new; and why should he not
      have his fancy, and why should not there be <i>Panton's Folly</i> as well
      as any of the thousand <i>Follies</i> in England? Surely he was rich
      enough to have a Folly. His physician cherished this bright idea. Mrs.
      Panton was all this time dying to have a villa on the Thames. Dr. Percy
      proposed that one should be made on Mr. Panton's plan. The villa was
      bought, and every day the hypochondriac&mdash;hypochondriac now no more&mdash;went
      to his villa-Crusoe, where he fussed, and furbished, and toiled at his
      desert island in the Thames, as hard as ever he laboured to make his <i>plum</i>
      in the counting-house. In <i>due course</i> he recovered his health, and,
      to use his own expression, "became as alert as any man in all England of
      his inches in the girth, thanks be to Dr. Percy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We find the following letter from Dr. Percy, written, as it appears, some
      months after his first attendance upon Mr. Panton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear friends at home, Alfred tells you truth, and does not
      flatter much. The having set up again this old citizen, who was thought
      bankrupt in constitution, has done me honour in the city; and, as Alfred
      assures you, has spread my name through Broad-street, and Fleet-street,
      and Milk-street, embracing the wide extremes between High-Holborn and St.

      she is pleased to call the wrong end of the town.

      "Mr. Gresham is unceasing and indefatigable in his kindness to me. I
      consider it as an instance of this kindness that he has found employment
      for my poor friend, O'Brien; has made him his porter&mdash;a pleasanter
      place than he had with the painter that pleased nobody: O'Brien sees me
      almost every day, and rejoices in what he calls my prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Heaven for ever prosper your honour' is the beginning and end of all he
      says, and, I believe, of all he thinks. Is not it singular, that my first

      seemed to threaten my ruin&mdash;the quarrel with Frumpton about O'Brien

      "Adieu, my dear friends; you must not expect such long letters from me now
      that I am becoming a busy man. Alfred and I see but little of one another,
      we live at such a distance, and we are both so gloriously industrious. But
      we have holiday minutes, when we meet and talk more in the same space of

      "P.S. I have just recollected that I forgot to answer your question about
      Mr. Henry. I do see him whenever I have time to go, and whenever he will
      come to Mr. Gresham's, which is very seldom. Mr. Gresham has begged him
      repeatedly to come to his house every Sunday, when Henry must undoubtedly
      be at leisure; yet Mr. Henry has been there but seldom since the first six
      weeks after he came to London. I cannot yet understand whether this arises
      from pride, or from some better motive. Mr. Gresham says he likes what he
      has seen of him, and well observes, that a young officer, who has lived a
      gay life in the army, must have great power over his own habits, and
      something uncommon in his character, to be both willing and able thus
      suddenly and completely to change his mode of life, and to conform to all
      the restraints and disagreeable circumstances of his new situation."

    <p>
      EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM MR. PERCY TO ERASMUS PERCY.
    </p>
    <p>
      "... Let me take the opportunity of your playful allusion to your present
      patrons, a porter and a hypochondriac, seriously to explain to you my
      principles about patronage&mdash;I never had any idea that you ought not
      to be assisted by friends: friends which have been made for you by your
      parents I consider as part of your patrimony. I inherited many from my
      father, for which I respect and bless his name. During the course of my
      life, I have had the happiness of gaining the regard of some persons of
      talents and virtue, some of them in high station; this regard will extend
      to my children while I live, and descend to them when I am no more. I
      never <i>cultivated</i> them with a view to advancing my family, but I
      make no doubt that their friendship will assist my sons in their progress
      through their several professions. I hold it to be just and right that
      friends should give, and that young men should gratefully accept, all the
      means and opportunities of bringing professional acquirements and
      abilities into notice. Afterwards, the merit of the candidate, and his
      fitness for any given situation, ought, and probably will, ultimately
      decide whether the assistance has been properly or improperly given. If
      family friends procure for any young man a reward of any kind which he has
      not merited, I should object to that as much as if the place or the reward
      had been bestowed by a professed patron from political or other interested
      motives. If my friends were to assist you <i>merely</i> because you were
      my sons, bore my name, or represented the Percy estate, I should not think
      this just or honourable; but they know the principles which have been
      instilled into you, and the education you have received: from these they
      can form a judgment of what you are likely to be, and for what situations
      you are qualified; therefore it is but reasonable that they should
      recommend you preferably to strangers, even of equal ability. Every young
      man has friends, and they will do all they can to assist him: if they do
      so according to his merits, they do well; if in spite of his demerits,
      they do ill; but whilst nothing is practised to prevent the course of free
      competition, there can be no evil to the community, and there is no
      injurious patronage. So much for family friends. Now as to friends of your
      own making, they are as much your own earning, and all the advantage they
      can be of to you is as honourably yours, as your fees. Whatever assistance
      you may receive from Mr. Gresham I consider in this light. As to gratitude&mdash;I
      acknowledge that in some cases gratitude might be guilty of partial
      patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you had saved a minister of state from breaking his neck, and he in
      return had made you surgeon-general to our armies, without knowing whether
      you were qualified for that situation, I should call that partial and
      pernicious patronage; but if you had cured a great man of a dangerous
      disease, and he afterwards exerted himself to recommend you as a physician
      to his friends and acquaintance, this I should consider as part of your
      fit reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So now, my dear son, I hope you fully understand me, and that you will
      not attribute to me false delicacies, and a prudery, a puritanism of
      independence, which I utterly disclaim.&mdash;Go on, and prosper, and
      depend upon the warm sympathy and entire approbation of your affectionate
      father,

      LETTER FROM ALFRED PERCY TO ROSAMOND.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR ROSAMOND,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for your letters from Hungerford Castle. If Mr. Barclay had
      been but ten years younger, and if he had been ten degrees more a laughing
      philosopher, and if Caroline could but have loved him, I should have had
      no objection to him for a brother-in-law; but as my three <i>ifs</i> could
      not be, I regret the Leicestershire estate as little as possible, and I
      will console myself for not having the marriage settlements to draw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your letters were great delights to me. I kept them to read when the
      business of the day was done, and I read them by my single candle in my
      lone chamber. I would rather live in my lone chamber all my days, and
      never see a wax-light all my nights, than be married to your Lady Angelica
      Headingham. I give Mr. Barclay joy of having escaped from her charms. I
      prefer an indenture tripartite, however musty or tiresome, to a triple
      tyrant, however fair or entertaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you expect me to be very entertaining next vacation, and you expect to
      hear all I have seen, heard, felt, and understood since I came to London.
      Alas! Rosamond, I have no wonders to relate; and lest you should be
      disappointed when we meet, I had best tell you now and at once all I have
      to say about myself. My history is much like that of the first years at
      the bar of every young lawyer&mdash;short and bitter&mdash;much law and
      few fees. Some, however, I have received.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A few of my father's friends, who are so unfortunate as to be at law,
      have been so good as to direct their attorneys to give me briefs. But most
      of his friends, to my loss&mdash;I am too generous, observe, to say <i>to
      my sorrow</i>&mdash;are wise enough to keep clear of lawsuits. I heard his
      friend, the late chancellor, say the other day to some one who wanted to
      plunge into a suit in Chancery, 'If any body were to take a fancy to a
      corner of my estate, I would rather&mdash;provided always that nobody knew
      it&mdash;let him have it than go to law for it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But to go on with my own affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little while after my interview with Lord Oldborough, his lordship, to
      my surprise&mdash;for I thought his offer to assist me in my profession,
      if ever it should lie in his line, was a mere courtier's promise&mdash;sent
      his attorney to me, with a brief in a cause of Colonel Hauton's. The
      colonel has gone to law (most ungrateful as he is) with his uncle, who was
      his guardian, and who managed all his affairs for years. I need not
      explain to you the merits of the suit, or the demerits of the plaintiff.
      It is enough to tell you that I was all-glorious, with the hope of <i>making
      a good point</i> which had escaped the other counsel employed on our side;
      but the senior counsel never acknowledged the assistance he had received
      from me&mdash;obtained a nonsuit against the colonel, and had all the
      honour and triumph of the day. Some few gentlemen of the bar knew the
      truth, and they were indignant. I hear that my senior, whose name I will
      never tell you lest you should hate it, has got into great practice by the
      gaining of this suit. Be that as it may, I would not change places and
      feelings with him at this moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. Grose, Lord Oldborough's solicitor, a rich rogue and very saucy, was
      obliged to employ me, because his client ordered it, and Lord Oldborough
      is not a man to be disobeyed, either in private or public affairs: but the
      attorney was obviously vexed and scandalized by his lordship's employing
      me, a young barrister, of whom nobody had ever heard, and who was not
      recommended by him, or under the protection even of any solicitor of
      eminence. Mr. Grose knew well how the suit was gained, but he never
      mentioned it to Lord Oldborough; on the contrary, he gave all the credit
      to my <i>senior</i>. This dry story of a <i>point</i> law is the most
      interesting thing I have to tell you about myself. I have seen nothing,
      heard nothing, know nothing, but of law, and I begin to feel it difficult
      to write, speak, or think, in any but professional language. Tell my
      father, that I shall soon come to talking law Latin and law French.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know no more of what is going on in this great metropolis than if I
      were at Tobolski. Buckhurst Falconer used to be my newspaper, but since he
      has given up all hopes of Caroline, he seldom comes near me. I have lost
      in him my fashionable Daily Advertiser, my Belle Assemblée, and
      tête-à-tête magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last Sunday, I went to his fashionable chapel to hear him preach: he is
      much admired, but I don't like his manner or his sermons&mdash;too
      theatrical and affected&mdash;too rhetorical and antithetical, evidently
      more suited to display the talents of the preacher than to do honour to
      God or good to man. He told me, that if he could preach himself into a
      deanery, he should think he had preached to some purpose; and could die
      with a safe conscience, as he should think he had not laboured in vain in
      his vocation. Of all men, I think a dissipated clergyman is the most
      contemptible. How much Commissioner Falconer has to answer for, who forced
      him, or who lured him, knowing how unfit he was for it, into the church!
      The commissioner frets because the price of iniquity has not yet been
      received&mdash;the living of Chipping Friars is not yet Buckhurst's. The
      poor paralytic incumbent, for whose death he is praying daily, is still
      living; and, as Buckhurst says, may shake on many a long year. How
      Buckhurst lives in the mean time at the rate he does I cannot tell you&mdash;that
      art of living in style upon nothing is an art which I see practised by
      numbers, but which is still a mystery to me. However, the Falconers seem
      in great favour at present; the commissioner hopes Lord Oldborough may do
      something for Buckhurst. Last Sunday, when I went to hear him preach, I
      saw the whole family of the Falconers, in grandeur, in the Duke of
      Greenwich's seat. The Marchioness of Twickenham was there, and looked
      beautiful, but, as I thought, unhappy. After the sermon, I heard Lady
      Somebody, who was in the next seat to me, whisper to a Lady Otherbody,
      just as she was rising after the blessing, 'My dear madam, did you hear
      the shocking report about the Marchioness of Twickenham?' then a very
      close and confidential whisper; then, loud enough for me to hear, 'But I
      do suppose, as there are hopes of an heir, all will be hushed&mdash;for
      the present.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just then the Duke of Greenwich and the marquis and marchioness came down
      the aisle, and as they passed, my scandal-mongers smiled, and curtsied,
      and were so delighted to see their dear marchioness! The Miss Falconers,
      following in the wake of nobility, seemed too much charmed with
      themselves, to see or know me&mdash;till Lord Oldborough, though listening
      to the duke, espied me, and did me the honour to bow; then the misses put
      up their glasses to see who I could be, and they also smiled, and
      curtsied, and were delighted to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is well for us that we don't live on their smiles and curtsies. They
      went off in the Marchioness of Twickenham's superb equipage. I had a full
      view of her as she drew up the glass, and a more melancholy countenance
      than hers I have seldom seen. Lord Oldborough hoped my father was well&mdash;but
      never mentioned Godfrey. The marchioness does not know me, but she turned
      at the name of Percy, and I thought sighed. Now, Rosamond, I put that sigh
      in for you&mdash;make what you can of it, and of the half-heard mysterious
      whisper. I expect that you will have a romance in great forwardness,
      before Monday, the 3rd of next month, when I hope to see you all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No letters from Godfrey.&mdash;Erasmus has been so busy of late, he tells
      me, he has not had time to record for you all his doings. In one word, he
      is doing exceedingly well. His practice increases every day in the city in
      spite of Dr. Frumpton. Adieu till Monday, the 3rd&mdash;Happy Monday!&mdash;'Restraint
      that sweetens liberty.' My dear Rosamond, which do you think loves
      vacation-time most, a lawyer or a school-boy?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was interrupted just now by a letter from a certain farmer of the name
      of Grimwood, who has written to me, 'because I am a friend to justice, and
      my father's son,' &amp;c., and has given me a long account of a quarrel he
      has with Dr. Leicester about the tithe of peaches&mdash;said Grimwood is
      so angry, that he can neither spell nor write intelligibly, and he swears
      that if it cost him a thousand guineas in gold, he will have the law of
      the doctor. I wish my father would be so kind as to send to Mr. Grimwood
      (he lives at Pegginton), and advise him to keep clear of Attorney Sharpe,
      and to keep cool, if possible, till Monday, the 3rd, and then I will make
      up the quarrel if I can. Observe, more is to be done on Monday, the 3rd,
      than ever was done on any other Monday.

      "Your affectionate brother,
    </p>
    <p>
      "ALFRED PERCY.
    </p>
    <p>
      "P.S.&mdash;I open my letter to tell you a delightful piece of news&mdash;that
      Lord Oldborough has taken Temple for his private secretary, and will bring
      him in for the borough of &mdash;&mdash;. How his lordship found him out
      to be the author of that famous pamphlet, which bore Cunningham's name, I
      do not know. I know that I kept the secret, as in honour bound; but Lord
      Oldborough has the best ways and means of obtaining intelligence of any
      man in England. It is singular that he never said one word about the
      pamphlet to Temple, nor ever appeared to him to know that it was his
      writing. I cannot understand this."
    </p>
    <p>
      To comprehend why Lord Oldborough had never mentioned the pamphlet to Mr.
      Temple, it was necessary to know more than Alfred had opportunities of
      discovering of this minister's character. His lordship did not choose to
      acknowledge to the world that he had been duped by Cunningham Falconer.
      Lord Oldborough would sooner repair an error than acknowledge it. Not that
      he was uncandid; but he considered candour as dangerous and impolitic in a
      public character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon some occasion, soon after Mr. Temple came to be his lordship's
      secretary, Mr. Temple acknowledged to a gentleman, in Lord Oldborough's
      presence, some trifling official mistake he had made: Lord Oldborough, as
      soon as the gentleman was gone, said to his secretary, "Sir, if you make a
      mistake, repair it&mdash;that is sufficient. Sir, you are young in
      political life&mdash;you don't know, I see, that candour hurts a political
      character in the opinion of fools&mdash;that is, of the greater part of
      mankind. Candour may be advantageous to a moral writer, or to a private
      gentleman, but not to a minister of state. A statesman, if he would govern
      public opinion, must establish a belief in his infallibility."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this principle Lord Oldborough abided, not only by his own measures,
      but by his own instruments&mdash;right or wrong, he was known to support
      those whom he had once employed or patronised. Lucky this for the Falconer
      family!

      LETTER FROM ALFRED TO ERASMUS.

    <p>
      "MY DEAR DOCTOR,
    </p>
    <p>
      "How I pity you who have no vacations! Please, when next you sum up the
      advantages and disadvantages of the professions I of law and medicine, to
      set down <i>vacations</i> to the credit side of the law. You who work for
      life and death can have no pause, no respite; whilst I from time to time
      may, happily, leave all the property, real and personal, of my
      fellow-creatures, to its lawful or unlawful owners. Now, for six good
      weeks to come, I may hang sorrow and cast away care, and forget the sound
      and smell of parchments, and the din of the courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here I am, a happy prisoner at large, in this nutshell of a house at the
      Hills, which you have never seen since it has become the family mansion. I
      am now in the actual tenure and occupation of the little room, commonly
      called Rosamond's room, bounded on the N. E. W. and S. by blank&mdash;[N.B.
      a very dangerous practice of leaving blanks for your boundaries in your
      leases, as an eminent attorney told me last week.] Said room containing in
      the whole 14 square feet 4-1/2 square inches, superficial measure, be the
      same more or less. I don't know how my father and mother, and sisters, who
      all their lives were used to range in spacious apartments, can live so
      happily, cooped up as they now are; but their bodies, as well as minds,
      seem to have a contractile power, which adapts them to their present
      confined circumstances. Procrustes, though he was a mighty tyrant, could
      fit only the body to the bed. I found all at home as cheerful and
      contented as in the days when we lived magnificently at Percy-hall. I have
      not seen the Hungerfords yet; Colonel H. is, I hear, attached to Lady
      Elizabeth Pembroke. I know very little of her, but Caroline assures me she
      is an amiable, sensible woman, well suited to him, and to all his family.
      I need not, however, expatiate on this subject, for Caroline says that she
      wrote you a long letter, the day after she returned from Hungerford
      Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must tell you what has happened to me since I came to the country. Do
      you remember my receiving a very angry, very ill-spelled letter, from a
      certain Farmer Grimwood of Pegginton, who swore, that if it cost him a
      thousand guineas in gold he would have the law of <i>the doctor</i>&mdash;viz.
      Dr. Leicester&mdash;about a tithe of peaches? My father, at my request,
      was so good as to send for said Grimwood, and to prevent him from having
      recourse in his ire to Attorney Sharpe. With prodigious difficulty, the
      angry farmer was restrained till my arrival; when I came home, I found him
      waiting for me, and literally foaming at the mouth with the furious desire
      for law. I flatter myself, I did listen to his story with a patience for
      which Job might have been admired. I was well aware that till he had
      exhausted himself, and was practically convinced that he had nothing more
      to say, he would be incapable of listening to me, or to the voice of the
      angel of peace. When at last absolute fatigue of reiteration had reduced
      him to silence, when he had held me by the button till he was persuaded he
      had made me fully master of his case, I prevailed upon him to let me hear
      what could be said on the opposite side of the question; and after some
      hours' cross-examination of six witnesses, repeaters, and reporters, and
      after an infinite confusion of <i>said I's, and said he's</i>, it was made
      clearly to appear that the whole quarrel originated in the mistake of a
      few words in a message which Dr. Leicester's agent had given to his son, a
      boy of seven years old, who had left it with a deaf gate-keeper of
      seventy-six, who repeated it to Farmer Grimwood, at a moment when the
      farmer was over-heated and overtired, and consequently prone to <i>misunderstanding</i>
      and to anger. The most curious circumstance in the whole business is, that
      the word peaches had never been mentioned by Dr. Leicester's agent in the
      original message; and Dr. Leicester really did not know that Mr. Grimwood
      of Pegginton was possessed of a single peach. Grimwood, though uncommonly
      obstinate and slow, is a just man; and when I at last brought the facts
      with indisputable evidence home to his understanding, he acknowledged that
      he had been too hasty, rejoiced that he had not gone to law, begged the
      doctor and the doctor's agent's pardon, thanked me with his whole honest
      heart, and went home in perfect charity with all mankind. Mr. Sharpe, who
      soon heard of the amicable conclusion of this affair, laughs at me, and
      pronounces that I shall never make a lawyer, and that my friends need
      never flatter themselves with the notion of my rising at the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "A. PERCY.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My letter was forgotten yesterday, and I am glad of it. Blessings on
      Farmer Grimwood of Pegginton! Little did I think that he and his quarrel
      about tithe peaches would have such happy influence on my destiny.
      Blessings on Farmer Grimwood of Pegginton! I repeat: he has been the cause
      of my seeing such a&mdash;of my receiving such a look of approbation&mdash;such
      a smile! She is niece to our good rector&mdash;come to spend a few days
      with him. Grimwood went to the vicarage to make up his quarrel with Dr.
      Leicester&mdash;I do not know what he said of me, but I find it has left a
      very favourable impression in the good doctor's mind. He came here
      yesterday, and brought with him his charming niece. My dear Erasmus, you
      know that I have often prayed that I might never fall in love <i>seriously</i>,
      till I had some reasonable prospect of being able to marry; but I begin to
      retract my prayer for indifference, and to be of opinion that the most
      prudent thing a professional man can do is to fall in love&mdash;to fall
      in love with such a woman as Sophia Leicester. What a new motive for
      exertion! Animated by delightful hope, perseverance, even in the most
      stupid drudgery, will be pleasure. Hope!&mdash;but I am far from hope&mdash;far
      at this instant from knowing distinctly what I hope&mdash;or wish&mdash;or
      mean. I will write again soon and explain."

      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In several successive letters of Alfred to his brother, the progress of
      his attachment to Miss Leicester is described. Instead of paying a visit
      of a few days to her uncle, it appears that she stayed at the vicarage
      during the whole of Alfred's vacation. Her mother died, and, contrary to
      the expectation I of some of her admirers, Miss Leicester was left in
      possession of only a moderate fortune. She showed much dignity under these
      adverse circumstances, with a charming mixture of spirit and gentleness of
      disposition. The change in her expectations, which deprived her of some of
      her fashionable admirers, showed I her the superior sincerity and
      steadiness of Alfred's sentiments. No promises were given on either side;
      but it appears, that Alfred was permitted to live and labour upon hope. He
      returned to London more eager than ever to pursue his profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      We trust that our readers will be fully satisfied with this abridgment of
      the affair, and will be more inclined to sympathize with Alfred, and to
      wish well to his attachment, than if they had been fatigued with a volume
      of his love-letters, and with those endless repetitions of the same
      sentiments with which most lovers' letters abound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now go on to the affairs of Erasmus Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Panton, provoked by his daughter's coldness towards Lord Roadster, had
      begun shrewdly to suspect that the lady must be in love with some other
      person. His young physician was the only man on whom he could fix his
      suspicions. Constance seemed to be on a more confidential footing with him
      than with any of the visitors who frequented his house; she had spoken of
      him in terms of high approbation, and had not contradicted her father when
      he had, purposely to try her, pronounced Dr. Percy to be the handsomest
      young fellow he knew. While these suspicions were secretly gaining
      strength in the father's mind, a circumstance occurred which confirmed
      them at once, and caused them to burst forth with uncontrolled violence of
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Percy was called in to prescribe for a sick lawyer, and from this
      lawyer's conversation he learnt that Lord Runnymede was a ruined man, and
      that his son Lord Roadster's extravagance had been the cause of his ruin.
      Erasmus determined to put Mr. Panton upon his guard, and thus, if
      possible, to prevent the amiable Constance from becoming a victim to her
      father's absurd ambition. With this view he went to Mr. Panton's. The old
      gentleman was gone to dine with his club. Mrs. Panton, in her elegant
      language, desired he would leave his business with her. When he had
      explained the purport of his visit, after a variety of vulgar exclamations
      denoting surprise and horror, and after paying many compliments to her own
      sagacity, all which appeared incompatible with her astonishment, Mrs.
      Panton expressed much gratitude to Erasmus, mixed with suppressed
      satisfaction, and significant nods which he could not quite comprehend.
      Her gratitude was interrupted, and the whole train of her ideas changed,
      by the entrance of a milliner with new caps and artificial flowers. She,
      however, retained sufficient recollection of what had passed, to call
      after Erasmus when he had taken his leave, and to insist upon his coming
      to her party that evening. This he declined. Then she said he <i>must</i>
      dine with her next day, for let him be never so busy, he must dine
      somewhere, and as good dine with somebody as with nobody&mdash;in short,
      she would take no denial. The next day Erasmus was received with
      ungracious oddity of manner by old Panton&mdash;the only person in the
      drawing-room when he arrived. Erasmus was so much struck with the gloom of
      his countenance, that he asked whether Mr. Panton felt himself ill. Panton
      bared his wrist, and held out his hand to Erasmus to feel his pulse&mdash;then
      withdrawing his hand, he exclaimed, "Nonsense! I'm as well as any man in
      England. Pray, now, Doctor Percy, why don't you get a wig?"&mdash;"Why
      should I, sir, when I have hair?" said Erasmus, laughing.&mdash;"Pshaw!
      doctor, what signifies laughing when I am serious!&mdash;Why, sir, in my
      youth every decent physician wore a wig, and I have no notion of a good
      physician without a wig&mdash;particularly a young one. Sir, many people
      have a great objection to a young physician for many reasons. And take my
      advice in time, Doctor Percy&mdash;a wig, a proper wig, not one of your
      modern natural scratches, but a decent powdered doctor's bob, would make
      you look ten years older at one slap, and trust me you'd get into practice
      fast enough then, and be sent for by many a sober family, that would never
      think of letting you within their doors without the wig; for, sir, you are
      too young and too handsome for a physician&mdash;Hey! what say you to the
      wig?" concluded Panton, in a tone of such serious, yet comical impatience,
      that Erasmus found it difficult to restrain a smile, whilst he answered
      that he really did not think his charms were so dangerous that it was
      necessary to disguise them by a wig; that as to his youth, it was an
      objection which every day would tend to lessen; and that he trusted he
      might obtain the credit of being a good physician if he could cure people
      of their diseases; and they would feel it to be a matter of indifference
      whether they were restored to health by a doctor in a wig or without one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indifference!" cried Panton, starting upright in his chair with passion.
      "I don't know what you call a matter of indifference, sir; I can tell you
      its no matter of indifference to me&mdash;If you mean me; for say that
      with God's mercy you carried me through, what then, if you are doing your
      best to break my heart after all&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Panton stopped short, for at this instant Constance came into the
      room, and her father's look of angry suspicion, and her blush, immediately
      explained to Erasmus what had the moment before appeared to him
      unintelligible. He felt provoked with himself for colouring in his turn,
      and being embarrassed without any reason, but he recovered his presence of
      mind directly, when Constance, with a dignified ingenuous modesty of
      manner, advanced towards him, notwithstanding her father's forbidding
      look, and with a sweet, yet firm voice, thanked him for his yesterday's
      friendly visit to her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder you a'n't ashamed of yourself, girl!" cried old Panton, choking
      with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I'm sure I wonder you a'n't ashamed of yourself, Mr. Panton, if you
      come to that," cried Mrs. Panton, "exposing of your family affairs this
      way by your unseasonable passions, when one has asked people to dinner
      too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dinner or no dinner," cried old Panton, and he must have been strangely
      transported beyond himself when he made that exclamation, "dinner or no
      dinner, Mrs. Panton, I will speak my mind, and be master in my own house!
      So, Doctor Percy, if you please, we'll leave the ladies, and talk over our
      matters our own way, in my own room here within."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Percy willingly acceded to this proposal. Old Panton waddled as fast
      as he could to show the way through the antechamber, whilst Mrs. Panton
      called after him, "Don't expose yourself no more than you can help, my
      dear!" And as Erasmus passed her, she whispered, "Never mind him, doctor&mdash;stand
      by yourself&mdash;I'll stand by you, and <i>we'll</i> stand by you&mdash;won't
      we, Constance?&mdash;see her colour!"&mdash;"We have reason to be grateful
      to Dr. Percy," said Constance, gravely, with an air of offended modesty;
      "and I hope," added she, with softened sweetness of tone, as she looked at
      him, and saw his feelings in his countenance, "I hope Doctor Percy is
      assured of my gratitude, and of my perfect esteem."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come! what the devil?" cried old Panton, "I thought you were close behind
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, doctor," cried he, as soon as he had fairly got Erasmus into his
      closet, and shut the door, "now, doctor, I suppose you see I am not a man
      to be imposed upon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor, if you were, am I a man to impose upon you, sir," said Erasmus. "If
      I understand you rightly, Mr. Panton, you suspect me of some designs upon
      your daughter? I have none."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you won't have the assurance to deny that you are in love with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not in love with Miss Panton, sir: she has charms and virtues which
      might create the strongest attachment in the heart of any man of feeling
      and discernment who could permit himself to think of her; but I am not in
      a situation in which I could, with honour, seek to win her affections,
      and, fortunately for me, this reflection has probably preserved my heart
      from danger. If I felt any thing like love for your daughter, sir, you may
      be assured that I should not, at this instant, be in your house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mighty fine speech, sir! and well delivered, for aught I know. You are
      a scholar, and can speak sentences; but that won't impose on me, a plain
      man that has eyes. Why&mdash;tell me!&mdash;didn't I see you within these
      two minutes blushing up to the eyes, both of you, at one another? Don't I
      know when I see men and women in love&mdash;tell me! Mrs. Panton&mdash;fudge!&mdash;And
      did not I see behind my back, just now, the women conjuring with you?&mdash;And
      aren't you colouring over head and ears with conscience this very instant?&mdash;Tell
      me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Erasmus in vain asserted his own and the young lady's innocence, and
      maintained that blushing was no proof of guilt&mdash;he even adverted to
      the possibility of a man's blushing for others instead of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blush for me as much as you please, if it's me you allude to," cried the
      coarse father; "but when my daughter's at stake, I make no bones of
      speaking plain, and cutting the matter short in the beginning&mdash;for we
      all know what love is when it comes to a head. Marrow-bones! don't I know
      that there must be some reason why that headstrong girl won't think of my
      Lord Runnymede's son and heir, and such a looking youth, title and all, as
      my Lord Roadster! And you are the cause, sir; and I thank you for opening
      my eyes to it, as you did by your information to Mrs. Panton yesterday, in
      my absence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Erasmus protested with such an air of truth as would have convinced any
      person capable of being convinced, that, in giving that information, he
      had been actuated solely by a desire to save Miss Panton from a ruinous
      match, by honest regard for her and all her family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ruinous!&mdash;You are wrong, sir&mdash;I know better&mdash;I know best&mdash;I
      saw my Lord Runnymede himself this very morning&mdash;a little temporary
      want of cash only from the estate's being tied up, as they sometimes tie
      estates, which all noble families is subject to&mdash;Tell me! don't I
      know the bottom of these things? for though I haven't been used to land, I
      know all about it. And at worst, my Lord Roadster, my son-in-law that is
      to be, is not chargeable with a penny of his father's debts. So your
      informer is wrong, sir, every way, and no lawyer, sir, for I have an
      attorney at my back&mdash;and your information's all wrong, and you had no
      need to interfere."
    </p>
    <p>
      Erasmus felt and acknowledged the imprudence of his interference, but
      hoped it might be forgiven in favour of the motive&mdash;and he looked so
      honestly glad to hear that his information was all wrong, that old Panton
      at the moment believed in his integrity, and said, stretching out his hand
      towards him, "Well, well, no harm done&mdash;then it's all as it should
      be, and we may ring for dinner&mdash;But," recurring again to his
      favourite idea, "you'll get the wig, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me," said Erasmus, laughing, "your confidence in me cannot depend
      upon a wig."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can, sir, and it does," cried Panton, turning again with all his anger
      revived. "Excuse you! No, sir, I won't; for the wig's my test, and I told
      Mrs. Panton so last night&mdash;the wig's my test of your uprightness in
      this matter, sir; and I fairly tell you, that if you refuse this, all the
      words you can string don't signify a button with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And by what right, sir, do you speak to me in this manner?" cried
      Erasmus, proudly, for he lost all sense of the ludicrous in indignation at
      the insolent doubt of his integrity, which, after all the assurances he
      had given, these last words from Mr. Panton implied: "By what right, sir,
      do you speak to me in this manner?&mdash;And what reason can you have to
      expect that I should submit to any tests to convince you of the truth of
      my assertions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right! Reason!" cried Panton. "Why, doctor, don't you know that I'm your
      patron?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My patron!" repeated Erasmus, in a tone which would have expressed much
      to the mind of any man of sense or feeling, but which conveyed no idea to
      the gross apprehension of old Panton except that Dr. Percy was ignorant of
      the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your patron&mdash;yes, doctor&mdash;why, don't you know, that ever since
      you set me upon my legs I have been going up and down the city puffing&mdash;that
      is, I mean, recommending you to all my friends? and you see you're of
      consequence&mdash;getting into fine practice for so young a man. And it
      stands to reason that when one takes a young man by the hand, one has a
      right to expect one's advice should be followed; and as to the wig, I
      don't make it a test&mdash;you've an objection to a test&mdash;but, as
      I've mentioned it to Mrs. Panton, I must make it a point, and you know I
      am not a man to go back. And you'll consider that if you disoblige me, you
      can't expect that I should continue my friendship, and protection, and
      patronage, and all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be assured, sir, I expect nothing from you," said Erasmus, "and desire
      nothing: I have the happiness and honour to belong to a profession, in
      which, if a man merits confidence, he will succeed, without requiring any
      man's patronage."&mdash;Much less the patronage of such a one as you!
      Erasmus would have said, but that he commanded his indignation, or,
      perhaps, it was extinguished by contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant now came to announce that the company was arrived, and dinner
      was waiting. In very bad humour, Mr. Panton, nevertheless, ate an
      excellent dinner, growling over every thing as he devoured it. Constance
      seemed much grieved by her father's unseasonable fit of rudeness and
      obstinacy; with sweetness of temper and filial duty she bore with his
      humour, and concealed it as far as she could from observation. Mrs. Panton
      was displeased with this, and once went so far as to whisper to Erasmus
      that her step-daughter wanted spirit sadly, but that he ought never to
      mind that, but to take a broad hint, and keep his ground. Erasmus, who,
      with great simplicity and an upright character, had quick observation and
      tact, perceived pretty nearly what was going on in the family. He saw that
      the step-mother, under an air of frank and coarse good-nature, was cunning
      and interested; that she wished to encourage the daughter to open war with
      the father, knowing that nothing could incense him so much as Constance's
      thinking of a poor physician instead of accepting of an earl's son; Mrs.
      Panton wished then to fan to a flame the spark which she was confident
      existed in his daughter's heart. Erasmus, who was not apt to fancy that
      ladies liked him, endeavoured to relieve Constance from the agonizing
      apprehension which he saw she felt of his being misled by her mother's
      hints: he appeared sometimes not to hear, and at other times not to
      understand, what Mrs. Panton whispered; and at last talked so loud across
      the table to Mr. Henry, about letters from Godfrey, and the officers of
      all the regiments in or out of England, that no other subject could be
      introduced, and no other voice could be heard. As soon as he decently
      could, after dinner, Dr. Percy took his leave, heartily glad to escape
      from his awkward situation, and from the patronage of Mr. Panton. Erasmus
      was mistaken, however, in supposing that Mr. Panton could do him no harm.
      It is true that he could not deny that Dr. Percy had restored him to
      health, and the opinion, which had spread in the city, of Dr. Percy's
      skill, was not, and could not, be diminished by Mr. Panton's railing
      against him; but when he hinted that the young physician had practised
      upon his daughter's heart, all the rich citizens who had daughters to
      watch began to consider him as a dangerous person, and resolved never to
      call him in, except in some desperate case. Mrs. Panton's gossiping
      confidences did more harm than her husband's loud complaints; and the very
      eagerness which poor Constance showed to vindicate Dr. Percy, and to
      declare the truth, served only to confirm the sagaciously-nodding mothers
      and overwise fathers in their own opinions. Mr. Henry said and did what he
      could for Erasmus; but what could be done by a young man shut up all day
      in a counting-house? or who would listen to any thing that was said by a
      youth without station or name? Mr. Gresham unluckily was at this time at
      his country-seat. Poor Erasmus found his practice in the city decline as
      rapidly as it had risen, and he began a little to doubt the truth of that
      noble sentiment which he had so proudly expressed. He was comforted,
      however, by letters from his father, who strongly approved his conduct,
      and who maintained that truth would at last prevail, and that the
      prejudice which had been raised against him would, in time, be turned to
      his advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that, while old Panton, in his present ludicrous fit of
      obstinacy, was caballing against our young physician with all his might in
      the city, the remote consequences of his absurdities were operating in Dr.
      Percy's favour at the west end of the town. Our readers may recollect
      having heard of a footman, whom Mr. Panton turned away for laughing at his
      perversity. Erasmus had at the time pleaded in the poor fellow's favour,
      and had, afterwards, when the servant was out of place, in distress, and
      ill, humanely attended him, and cured a child of his, who had inflamed
      eyes. This man was now in the service of a rich and very fine lady, who
      lived in Grosvenor-square&mdash;Lady Spilsbury. Her ladyship had several
      sickly children&mdash;children rendered sickly by their mother's
      overweening and injudicious care. Alarmed successively by every
      fashionable medical terror of the day, she dosed her children with every
      specific which was publicly advertised or privately recommended. No
      creatures of their age had taken such quantities of Ching's lozenges,
      Godbold's elixir, or Dixon's antibilious pills. The consequence was, that
      the dangers, which had at first been imaginary, became real: these little
      victims of domestic medicine never had a day's health: they looked, and
      were, more dead than alive. Still the mother, in the midst of hourly
      alarms, was in admiration of her own medical skill, which she said had
      actually preserved, in spite of nature, children of such sickly
      constitutions. In consequence of this conviction, she redoubled her
      vigilance, and the most trivial accident was magnified into a symptom of
      the greatest importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened on the day when the eldest Miss Spilsbury had miraculously
      attained her seventh year, a slight inflammation was discerned in her
      right eye, which was attributed by her mother to her having neglected the
      preceding day to bathe it in elder-flower water; by her governess, to her
      having sat up the preceding night to supper; by her maid, to her having
      been found peeping through a windy key-hole; and by the young lady
      herself, to her having been kept poring for two hours over her French
      lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might have been the original cause, the inflammation evidently
      increased, either in consequence or in spite of the innumerable remedies
      applied internally and externally&mdash;the eye grew redder and redder,
      and as red as blood, the nose inflamed, and the mother, in great alarm for
      the beauty as well as health of her child, sent for Sir Amyas Courtney. He
      had already won Lady Spilsbury's heart by recommending to her the <i>honan
      tcha</i>, or Tartar tea, which enables the Tartars to digest raw flesh,
      and tinges water of a red colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Amyas pronounced that the young lady had hereditary nerves, besought
      Lady Spilsbury to compose herself, assured her the inflammation was purely
      symptomatic, and as soon as he could subdue the continual nervous
      inclination to shrivel up the nose, which he trusted he could in time
      master, all would go well. But Sir Amyas attended every day for a month,
      yet never got the mastery of this nervous inclination. Lady Spilsbury then
      was persuaded <i>it could not be nerves, it must be scrofula</i>; and she
      called in Dr. Frumpton, <i>the man for scrofula</i>. He of course
      confirmed her ladyship in her opinion; for a week d&mdash;&mdash;d nerves
      and Sir Amyas; threw in desperate doses of calomel for another month,
      reduced the poor child to what the maid called an <i>attomy</i>, and still
      the inflammation increased. Lady Spilsbury desired a consultation of
      physicians, but Dr. Frumpton would not consult with Sir Amyas, nor would
      Sir Amyas consult with Dr. Frumpton. Lady Spilsbury began to dread that
      the sight of the eye would be injured, and this idea terrified the mother
      almost out of her senses. In the suspension of authority which terror
      produces in a family, the lady's-maid usually usurps considerable power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now her ladyship's maid had been offended by Dr. Frumpton's calling her <i>my
      good girl</i>, and by Sir Amyas Courtney's having objected to a green silk
      bandage which she had recommended; so that she could not <i>abide</i>
      either of the gentlemen, and she was confident the young lady would never
      get well while they had the management of affairs: she had heard&mdash;but
      she did not mention from whom, she was too diplomatic to give up her
      authority&mdash;she had heard of a young physician, a Dr. Percy, who had
      performed wonderful great cures in the city, and had in particular cured a
      young <i>lady</i> who had an inflamed eye, just for all the world like
      Miss Spilsbury's. In this last assertion, there was, perhaps, some little
      exaggeration; but it produced a salutary effect upon Lady Spilsbury's
      imagination: the footman was immediately despatched for Dr. Percy, and
      ordered to make all possible haste. Thus by one of those petty underplots
      of life, which, often unknown to us, are continually going on, our young
      physician was brought into a situation where he had an opportunity of
      showing his abilities. These favourable accidents happen to many men who
      are not able to make use of them, and thus the general complaint is
      preferred of want of good fortune, or of opportunity for talents to
      distinguish themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon Dr. Percy's arrival at Lady Spilsbury's, he immediately perceived
      that parties ran high, and that the partisans were all eager to know
      whether he would pronounce the young lady's case to be nervous or
      scrofulous. He was assailed by a multitude of female voices, and requested
      particularly to attend to innumerable contradictory symptoms, before he
      was permitted even to see his patient. He attended carefully to whatever
      facts he could obtain, pure from opinion and misrepresentation. The young
      lady was in a darkened room&mdash;he begged to have a little more light
      admitted, though she was in such pain that she could scarcely endure it.
      Our young physician had the great advantage of possessing the use of his
      senses and understanding, unbiassed by medical theories, or by the
      authority of great names: he was not always trying to force symptoms to
      agree with previous descriptions, but he was actually able to see, hear,
      and judge of them as they really appeared. There was a small protuberance
      on the left side of the nose, which, on his pressing it, gave great pain
      to the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me! miss, you know," said the maid, "it is not in your nose you feel
      the great pain&mdash;you know you told Sir Amyas Courtney t'other day&mdash;that
      is, Sir Amyas Courtney told you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Percy insisted that the child should be permitted to speak for
      herself; and, relieved from the apprehension of not saying the thing that
      she was expected to say, she described her present and past feelings. She
      said, "that the pain seemed lately to have <i>changed from where it was
      before</i>&mdash;that it had changed ever since Dr. Frumpton's opening his
      snuff-box near her had made her sneeze." This sneeze was thought by all
      but Dr. Percy to be a circumstance too trivial to be worth mentioning; but
      on this hint he determined to repeat the experiment. He had often thought
      that many of the pains which are supposed to be symptoms of certain
      diseases, many disorders which baffle the skill of medicine, originate in
      accidents, by which extraneous substances are taken or forced into
      different parts of the body. He ordered some cephalic snuff to be
      administered to the patient. All present looked with contempt at the
      physician who proposed such a simple remedy. But soon after the child had
      sneezed violently and repeatedly, Dr. Percy saw a little bit of green silk
      appear, which was drawn from the nostril, to the patient's great and
      immediate relief. Her brothers and sisters then recollected having seen
      her, two months before, stuffing up her nose a bit of green riband, which
      she said she liked because it smelt of some perfume. The cause of the
      inflammation removed, it soon subsided; the eye and nose recovered their
      natural size and colour, and every body said, "Who would have thought it?"
      all but Dr. Frumpton and Sir Amyas Courtney, who, in the face of
      demonstration, maintained each his own opinion; declaring that the green
      riband had nothing to do with the business. The sudden recovery of the
      child, Sir Amyas said, proved to him, in the most satisfactory manner,
      that the disease was, as he at first pronounced&mdash;nervous. Dr.
      Frumpton swore that scrofula would soon break out again in another shape;
      and, denouncing vengeance against generations yet unborn, he left Lady
      Spilsbury's children to take the consequences of trusting to a youngster,
      whose impertinent interference he could never forget or forgive. In spite
      of all that the two angry and unsuccessful physicians could say, the
      recovery of the child's eye redounded much to Dr. Percy's honour, and
      introduced him to the notice of several men of science and celebrity, who
      frequented Lady Spilsbury's excellent dinners. Even the intemperance of
      Dr. Frumpton's anger was of service; for in consequence of his furious
      assertions, inquiry was made into the circumstances, and the friends of
      Erasmus had then an opportunity of producing in his defence the Irish
      porter. His cause could not be in better hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that warmth and eloquence of gratitude characteristic of his country,
      the poor fellow told his story so as to touch every heart. Among others it
      particularly affected an officer just returned from our armies on the
      continent: and by him it was the next day repeated at the table of a
      celebrated general, when the conversation turned upon the conduct of
      certain army surgeons. Lord Oldborough happened to be one of the company;
      the name of Percy struck his ear; the moment Erasmus was thus brought to
      his recollection, he attended particularly to what the officer was saying;
      and, after hearing two circumstances, which were so marked with humanity
      and good sense, his lordship determined to give what assistance he could
      to the rising credit of the son of his old friend, by calling him in for
      Lady Oldborough, who was in a declining state of health. But Sir Amyas
      Courtney, who had long attended her ladyship, endeavoured, with all the
      address of hatred, to prejudice her against his young rival, and to
      prevent her complying with her lord's request. Depending on her habitual
      belief that he was essential to her existence, Sir Amyas went so far as to
      declare that if Dr. Percy should be sent for, he must discontinue his
      visits. Lord Oldborough, however, whom the appearance of opposition to his
      will always confirmed in his purpose, cut short the matter by a few
      peremptory words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Amyas, the soft silken Sir Amyas, could not for an instant stand
      before the terror of Lord Oldborough's eye: the moment he was told that he
      was at perfect liberty to discontinue his visits, his regard&mdash;his
      attachment&mdash;his devotion for Lady Oldborough, prevented the
      possibility of abandoning her ladyship; he was willing to sacrifice his
      private feelings, perhaps his private prejudices, his judgment, in short
      any thing, every thing, sooner than disoblige Lord Oldborough, or any of
      his family. Lord Oldborough, satisfied with the submission, scarcely
      stayed to hear the end of the speech, but rang the bell, ordered that Dr.
      Percy should be sent for, and went to attend a cabinet council.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Oldborough received him as it might be supposed that a very sickly,
      very much prejudiced, very proud lady of quality would receive a physician
      without a name, who was forced upon her in opposition to her long habits
      of reliance on her courtly favourite. Her present disease, as Dr. Percy
      believed, was water upon her chest, and there was some chance of saving
      her, by the remedies which have been found successful in a first attack of
      that complaint; but Sir Amyas had pronounced that her ladyship's disorder
      was merely nervous spasms, consequent upon a bilious attack, and he could
      not, or would not, recede from his opinion: his prescriptions, to which
      her ladyship devoutly adhered to the last, were all directed against bile
      and nerves. She would not hear of water on the chest, or take any of the
      remedies proposed by Dr. Percy. Lady Oldborough died ten days after he was
      called in. Those who knew nothing of the matter, that is, above
      nine-tenths of all who talked about it, affirmed that poor Lady
      Oldborough's death was occasioned by her following the rash prescriptions
      of a young physician, who had been forced upon her by Lord Oldborough; and
      who, unacquainted with her ladyship's constitution, had mistaken the
      nature of her complaint. All her ladyship's female relations joined in
      this clamour, for they were most of them friends or partizans of Sir Amyas
      Courtney. The rank and conspicuous situation of Lord Oldborough interested
      vast numbers in the discussion, which was carried on in every fashionable
      circle the day after her ladyship's decease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Percy took a decided step in this emergency. He went to the minister,
      to whom no one, friend or enemy, had ventured to give the slightest hint
      of the reports in circulation. Dr. Percy plainly stated the facts,
      represented that his character and the fate of his whole life were at
      stake, and besought his lordship to have the truth examined into by
      eminent and impartial physicians. Erasmus was aware of all he hazarded in
      making this request&mdash;aware that he must hurt Lord Oldborough's
      feelings&mdash;that he must irritate him by bringing to his view at once,
      and in this critical moment, a number of family cabals, of which he was
      ignorant&mdash;aware that Lord Oldborough was oppressed with business,
      public and private; and that, above all things, he was impatient of any
      intrusion upon his hours of privacy. But all these subordinate
      considerations vanished before Lord Oldborough's magnanimity. Without
      saying one word, he sat down and wrote an order, that proper means should
      be taken to ascertain the disease of which Lady Oldborough died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report made, in consequence of this order, by the surgeons, confirmed
      Dr. Percy's opinion that her ladyship's disease was water on the chest&mdash;and
      Lord Oldborough took effectual means to give the truth publicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need not thank me, Dr. Percy&mdash;you have a right to expect
      justice, more you will never want. My assistance might, it seems, have
      been injurious, but can never be necessary to your reputation."
    </p>
    <p>
      These few words&mdash;much from Lord Oldborough&mdash;and which he took
      care to say when they could be heard by numbers, were quickly circulated.
      The physicians and surgeons who had given in their report were zealous in
      maintaining the truth; medical and political parties were interested in
      the affair; the name of Dr. Percy was joined with the first names in the
      medical world, and repeated by the first people in the great world, so
      that with surprising celerity he became known and fashionable. And thus
      the very circumstance that threatened his ruin was, by his civil courage
      and decided judgment, converted into the means of his rising into
      eminence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late one night, after a busy and fatiguing day, just as Erasmus had got
      into bed, and was settling himself comfortably to sleep, he heard a loud
      knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Henry, sir, from Mr. Panton's in the city, wishes to speak with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Show him in.&mdash;So, old Panton, I suppose&mdash;some indigestion has
      brought him to reason?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! no such thing," interrupted Mr. Henry&mdash;"I would not have
      disturbed you at this time of night for any such trifle; but our excellent
      friend, Mr. Gresham&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of him?" cried Erasmus, starting up in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is ill,&mdash;but whether dangerously or not, I cannot tell you. An
      express from his house in the country has just arrived; I heard the letter
      read, but could not get it to bring to you. It was written to old Panton
      from Mr. Gresham's housekeeper, without her master's knowledge, as he has
      no opinion of physicians, she said, except of a young Dr. Percy, and did
      not like to send for him for such a trifle as a sore throat, lest it
      should hurt his practice to leave town at this season."
    </p>
    <p>
      Erasmus stayed to hear no more, but ordered horses instantly, set out, and
      travelled with all possible expedition. He had reason to rejoice that he
      had not made a moment's delay. He found Mr. Gresham actually suffocating
      from a quinsy. A surgeon had been sent for from the next town, but was not
      at home. Erasmus, the instant he saw Mr. Gresham, perceiving the danger,
      without saying one syllable, sprang to the bed, lanced the throat, and
      saved the life of his valuable friend. The surgeon, who came the next day,
      said that Dr. Percy ought to have waited for his arrival, and that a
      physician might be severely blamed for performing a surgical operation&mdash;that
      it was a very indelicate thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Gresham, who had fallen into a comfortable sleep, did not hear
      him; nor did Dr. Percy, who was writing the following letter to his
      father:
    </p>
    <p>
      "... You will sympathize with me, my dear father, and all my friends at
      home will sympathize in the joy I feel at seeing this excellent man, this
      kind friend, recovering under my care. These are some of the happy moments
      which, in my profession, repay us for years of toil, disappointment, and
      sufferings&mdash;yes, sufferings&mdash;for we must suffer with those that
      suffer: we must daily and hourly behold every form of pain, acute or
      lingering; numbers, every year of our lives, we must see perish, the
      victims of incurable disease. We are doomed to hear the groans of the
      dying, and the lamentations, sometimes the reproaches, of surviving
      friends; often and often must the candid and humane physician deplore the
      insufficiency of his art. But there are successful, gloriously successful
      moments, which reward us for all the painful duties, all the unavailing
      regrets of our profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This day I shall recall to my mind whenever my spirits sink, or whenever
      my fortitude begins to fail. I wish you could see the gratitude and joy in
      the looks of all Mr. Gresham's servants. His death would have been a
      public loss, for the beneficent use he makes of his princely fortune has
      rendered numbers dependent on him for the comforts of life. He lives here
      in a palace, and every thing he has done, whether in building or planting,
      in encouraging the useful or the fine arts, has been done with a judicious
      and magnificent spirit. Surely this man ought to be happy in his own
      reflections, and yet he does not seem to me as happy as he deserves to be.
      I shall stay here till I see him out of all danger of relapse.&mdash;He
      has just awakened&mdash;Adieu for the present."
    </p>
    <p>
      In continuation of this letter the following was written the next day:
    </p>
    <p>
      "All danger is over&mdash;my friend is convalescent, and I shall return to
      town to-morrow. But would you think, my dear father, that the real cause
      of Mr. Gresham's being unhappy is patronage? By accident I made use of
      that word in speaking of old Panton's quarrel with me, and he cursed the
      word the moment I pronounced it: 'Yes,' he exclaimed, 'it is twice
      accursed&mdash;once in the giving, and once in the receiving.' Then he
      began, in a most feeling manner, to describe the evils attendant upon
      being a patron. He has done his utmost to relieve and encourage genius in
      distress; but among all the poets, painters, artists, and men of letters,
      whom in various ways he has obliged, he has scarcely been able to satisfy
      the vanity or the expectations of any. Some have passed from excessive
      adulation to gross abuse of him&mdash;many more torment him continually
      with their complaints and invectives against each other; and, instead of
      having done good by his generosity, he finds that, in a variety of
      instances, of which he detailed the circumstances, he has done much
      mischief, and, as he says, infinite injury to his own peace of mind&mdash;for
      he has burdened himself with the care of a number of people, who cannot be
      made happy. He has to deal with men but partially cultivated; with <i>talents</i>,
      unaccompanied by reason, justice, or liberality of sentiment. With great
      feeling himself, he suffers acutely from all their jealousies and
      quarrels, and from the near and perpetual view of the <i>littleness</i> by
      which artists too often degrade themselves. Another man in Mr. Gresham's
      situation would become a misanthropist, and would comfort himself by
      railing against the ingratitude of mankind; but this would not comfort Mr.
      Gresham. He loves his fellow-creatures, and sees their faults in sorrow
      rather than in anger. I have known him, and intimately, for a considerable
      time, and yet I never heard him speak on this subject but once before,
      when the painter, whom I used to call the irritable genius, had
      caricatured him in return for all his kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Though it is not easy to change the habits or to alter the views and
      objects of a man, like Mr. Gresham, past the meridian of life, yet I
      cannot help flattering myself that this might be effected. If he would, by
      one bold effort, shake off these dependents, the evening of his days might
      yet be serene and happy. He wants friends, not <i>protégées</i>. I have
      advised him, as soon as his strength will permit, to take a little tour,
      which will bring him into your part of the country. He wishes much to
      become acquainted with all our family, and I have given him a note of
      introduction. You, my dear father, can say to him more than I could with
      propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Gresham knows how to accept as well as to give. He allows me to have
      the pleasure of proving to him, that where my friends are concerned, I am
      above pecuniary considerations. My love to my dear mother, Rosamond, and
      Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your affectionate son,
    </p>
    <p>
      "E. PERCY."
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Mr. Gresham would not hurt the feelings of his young friend and
      physician, by pressing upon him at the moment any remuneration, or by
      entering into any calculation of the loss he would sustain by his absence
      from London at this critical season, he took his own methods of justly
      recompensing Dr. Percy. Erasmus found at his door, some time after his
      return to town, a plain but excellent chariot and horses, with a note from
      Mr. Gresham, written in such terms as precluded the possibility of
      refusing the offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The celebrated London physician, who said that he was not paid for three
      weeks' attendance in the country, by a draft of two thousand pounds; and
      who, when the pen was put into his own hands, wrote four in the place of
      two, would smile in scorn at the generosity of Mr. Gresham and the
      disinterestedness of Dr. Percy.

    <p>
      LETTER FROM CAROLINE TO ERASMUS.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR ERASMUS,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your friend and patient, Mr. Gresham, was so eager to take your advice,
      and so quick in his movements, that your letter, announcing his intended
      visit, reached us but a few days before his arrival at the Hills. And&mdash;mark
      how great and little events, which seem to have no possible link of
      connexion, depend upon one another&mdash;Alfred or Mr. Gresham must have
      sat up all night, or slept on the floor, had not Alfred, that morning,
      received a letter from Mrs. Hungerford, summoning him to town to draw her
      son's marriage settlements. It is thought that Colonel Hungerford, whose
      leave of absence from his regiment has, by special favour, been repeatedly
      protracted, will be very soon sent abroad. Lady Elizabeth Pembroke has,
      therefore, consented to his urgent desire for their immediate union; and
      Alfred will, I am sure, give them as little reason as possible to complain
      of the law's delay. Lady Elizabeth, who has all that decision of mind and
      true courage which you know is so completely compatible with the most
      perfect gentleness of disposition and softness, even timidity of manners,
      resolves to leave all her relations and friends, and to go abroad. She
      says she knew what sacrifices she must make in marrying a soldier, and she
      is prepared to make them without hesitation or repining.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now to return to your friend, Mr. Gresham. The more we see of him the
      more we like him. Perhaps he bribed our judgment a little at first by the
      kind, affectionate manner in which he spoke of you; but, independently of
      this prepossession, we should, I hope, soon have discovered his merit. He
      is a good English merchant. Not a '<i>M. Friport, qui sçait donner, mais
      qui ne sçait pas vivre</i>,' but a well-bred, well-informed gentleman,
      upright, liberal, and benevolent, without singularity or oddities of any
      sort. His quiet, plain manners, free from ostentation, express so well the
      kind feelings of his mind, that I prefer them infinitely to what are
      called polished manners. Last night Rosamond and I were amusing ourselves
      by contrasting him with our recollection of the polished M. de Tourville&mdash;but
      as you were not at home at the memorable time of the shipwreck, and of M.
      de Tourville's visit, you cannot feel the force of our parallel between
      these two beings, the most dissimilar I have ever seen&mdash;an English
      merchant and a diplomatic Frenchman. You will ask, what put it into our
      heads to make the comparison? A slight circumstance which happened
      yesterday evening. Rosamond was showing Mr. Gresham some of my drawings,
      and among them the copy of that beautiful miniature in M. de Tourville's
      snuff-box. My father told him the history of Euphrosyne, of her German
      prince, and Count Albert. Mr. Gresham's way of listening struck us, by its
      contrast to the manner of M. de Tourville&mdash;and this led us on to draw
      a parallel between their characters. Mr. Gresham, instead of shrugging his
      shoulders, and smiling disdainfully, like the Frenchman, at the Quixotism
      of the young nobleman, who lost his favour at court by opposing the
      passion of his prince, was touched with Count Albert's disinterested
      character; and quite forgetting, as Rosamond observed, to compliment me
      upon my picture of Euphrosyne, he laid down the miniature with a
      negligence of which M. de Tourville never would have been guilty, and went
      on eagerly to tell some excellent traits of the count. For instance, when
      he was a very young man in the Prussian or Austrian service, I forget
      which, in the heat of an engagement he had his sabre lifted over the head
      of one of the enemy's officers, when, looking down, he saw that the
      officer's right arm was broken. The count immediately stopped, took hold
      of the disabled officer's bridle, and led him off to a place of safety.
      This and many other anecdotes Mr. Gresham heard, when he spent some time
      on the continent a few years ago, whilst he was transacting some
      commercial business. He had full opportunities of learning the opinions of
      different parties; and he says, that it was the prayer of all the good and
      wise in Germany, whenever the hereditary prince should succeed to the
      throne, that Count Albert Altenberg might be his minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By-the-bye, Mr. Gresham, though he is rather an elderly man, and looks
      remarkably cool and composed, shows all the warmth of youth whenever any
      of his feelings are touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you could see how much my father is pleased with your friend. He
      has frequently repeated that Mr. Gresham, long as he has been trained in
      the habits of mercantile life, is quite free from the spirit of monopoly
      in small or great affairs. My father rejoices that his son has made such a
      friend. Rosamond charged me to leave her room to write to you at the end
      of my letter; but she is listening so intently to something Mr. Gresham is
      telling her, that I do not believe she will write one line. I hear a few
      words, which so much excite my curiosity, that I must go and listen too.
      Adieu.

      "CAROLINE PERCY."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another letter from Caroline to Erasmus, dated some weeks after the
      preceding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tuesday, 14th.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear Erasmus, your friend, Mr. Gresham, is still with us; and he
      declares that he has not, for many years, been so happy as since he came
      here. He is now sufficiently intimate in this family to speak of himself,
      and of his own feelings and plans. You, who know what a horror he has of
      egotism, will consider this as a strong proof of his liking us, and of his
      confidence in our regard. He has related many of the instances, which, I
      suppose, he told you, of the ingratitude and disappointments he has met
      with from persons whom he attempted to serve. He has kept us all, for
      hours, Rosamond especially, in a state of alternate pity and indignation.
      For all that has happened, he blames himself more than he blames any one
      else; and with a mildness and candour which make us at once admire and
      love him, he adverts to the causes of his own disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father has spoken to him as freely as you could desire. He has urged,
      that as far as the public good is concerned, free competition is more
      advantageous to the arts and to artists than any private patronage can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the productions have real merit, they will make their own way; if they
      have not merit, they ought not to make their way. And the same argument he
      has applied to literary merit, and to the merit, generally speaking, of
      persons as well as of things. He has also plainly told Mr. Gresham that he
      considers the trade of a patron as one of the most thankless, as it is the
      least useful, of all trades.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All this has made such an impression upon your candid friend, that he has
      declared it to be his determination to have no more protégées, and to let
      the competition of talents work fairly without the interference, or, as he
      expressed it, any of the <i>bounties</i> and <i>drawbacks</i> of
      patronage. 'But then,' he added, with a sigh, 'I am a solitary being: am I
      to pass the remainder of my days without objects of interest or affection?
      While Constance Panton was a child, she was an object to me; but now she
      must live with her parents, or she will marry: at all events, she is rich&mdash;and
      is my wealth to be only for my selfish gratification? How happy you are,
      Mr. Percy, who have such an amiable wife, such a large family, and so many
      charming domestic objects of affection!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Gresham then walked away with my father to the end of the room, and
      continued his conversation in a low voice, to which I did not think I
      ought to listen, so I came up stairs to write to you. I think you told me
      that Mr. Gresham had suffered some disappointment early in life, which
      prevented his marrying; but if I am not mistaken, his mind now turns again
      to the hopes of domestic happiness. If I am not mistaken, Rosamond has
      made an impression on his heart. I have been as conveniently and
      meritoriously deaf, blind, and stupid, for some time past as possible; but
      though I shut my eyes, and stop my ears, yet my imagination will act, and
      I can only say to myself, as we used to do when we were children&mdash;I
      will not think of it till it comes, that I may have the pleasure of the
      surprise....
    </p>
    <p>
      "Affectionately yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      "CAROLINE PERCY."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline was right&mdash;Rosamond had made a great impression upon Mr.
      Gresham's heart. His recollection of the difference between his age and
      Rosamond's, and his consciousness of the want of the gaiety and
      attractions of youth, rendered him extremely diffident, and for some time
      suppressed his passion, at least delayed the declaration of his
      attachment. But Rosamond seemed evidently to like his company and
      conversation, and she showed that degree of esteem and interest for him
      which, he flattered himself, might be improved into a more tender
      affection. He ventured to make his proposal&mdash;he applied first to Mrs.
      Percy, and entreated that she would make known his sentiments to her
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Percy spoke to Rosamond, she was surprised at the very decided
      refusal which Rosamond immediately gave. Both Mrs. Percy and Caroline were
      inclined to think that Rosamond had not only a high opinion of Mr.
      Gresham, but that she had felt a preference for him which she had never
      before shown for any other person; and they thought that, perhaps, some
      refinement of delicacy about accepting his large fortune, or some fear
      that his want of high birth, and what are called good connexions, would be
      objected to by her father and mother, might be the cause of this refusal.
      Mrs. Percy felt extremely anxious to explain her own sentiments, and fully
      to understand Rosamond's feelings. In this anxiety Caroline joined most
      earnestly; all the kindness, sympathy, and ardent affection, which
      Rosamond had ever shown for her, when the interests of her heart were in
      question, were strong in Caroline's recollection, and these were now fully
      returned. Caroline thought Mr. Gresham was too old for her sister; but she
      considered that this objection, and all others, should yield to Rosamond's
      own opinion and taste. She agreed with her mother in imagining that
      Rosamond was not quite indifferent to his merit and to his attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Percy began by assuring Rosamond that she should be left entirely at
      liberty to decide according to her own judgment and feelings. "You have
      seen, my dear, how your father and I have acted towards your sister; and
      you may be sure that we shall show you equal justice. Though parents are
      accused of always rating 'a good estate above a faithful lover,' yet you
      will recollect that Mr. Barclay's good estate did not induce us to press
      his suit with Caroline. Mr. Gresham has a large fortune; and, to speak in
      Lady Jane Granville's style, it must be acknowledged, my dear Rosamond,
      that this would be a most advantageous match; but for this very reason we
      are particularly desirous that you should determine for yourself: at the
      same time, let me tell you, that I am a little surprised by the promptness
      of your decision. Let me be sure that this negative is serious&mdash;let
      me be sure that I rightly understand you, my love: now, when only your own
      Caroline is present, tell me what are your objections to Mr. Gresham?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks for her mother's kindness; thanks repeated, with tears in her eyes,
      were, for a considerable time, all the answer that could be obtained from
      Rosamond. At length she said, "Without having any particular objection to
      a person, surely, if I cannot love him, that is sufficient reason for my
      not wishing to marry him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond spoke these words in so feeble a tone, and with so much
      hesitation, colouring at the same time so much, that her mother and sister
      were still uncertain how they were to understand her <i>if</i>&mdash;and
      Mrs. Percy replied, "Undoubtedly, my dear, <i>if</i> you cannot love him;
      but that is the question. Is it quite certain that you cannot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! quite certain&mdash;I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This certainty seems to have come very suddenly," said her mother,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can you mean, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that you did not show any decided dislike to him, till within
      these few hours, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dislike! I don't feel&mdash;I hope I don't show any dislike&mdash;lam
      sure I should be very ungrateful. On the contrary, it would be impossible
      for any body, who is good for any thing, to <i>dislike</i> Mr. Gresham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you can neither like him nor dislike him?&mdash;You are in a state
      of absolute indifference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is, except gratitude&mdash;gratitude for all his kindness to
      Erasmus, and for his partiality to me&mdash;gratitude I certainly feel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And esteem?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; to be sure, esteem."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I think," continued her mother, "that before he committed this crime
      of proposing for you, Rosamond, you used to show some of the indignation
      of a good friend against those ungrateful people who used him so ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indignation! Yes," interrupted Rosamond, "who could avoid feeling
      indignation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And pity?&mdash;I think I have heard you express pity for poor Mr.
      Gresham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, ma'am, because he really was very much to be pitied&mdash;don't you
      think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do&mdash;and pity&mdash;" said Mrs. Percy, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed, mother, you need not smile&mdash;nor you, Caroline; for the
      sort of pity which I feel is not&mdash;it was merely pity by itself, plain
      pity: why should people imagine and insist upon it, that more is felt than
      expressed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," said Mrs. Percy, "I do not insist upon your feeling more than
      you really do; but let us see&mdash;you are in a state of absolute
      indifference, and yet you feel esteem, indignation, pity&mdash;how is
      this, Rosamond? How can this be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very easily, ma'am, because by absolute indifference, I mean&mdash;Oh!
      you know very well what I mean&mdash;absolute indifference as to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love, perhaps, is the word which you cannot pronounce this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, mother! Now, Caroline! You fancy that I love him. But, supposing
      there were any <i>if</i> in the case on my side, tell me only <i>why</i> I
      should refuse him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, my dear, that is what we wait to hear from you," said Mrs. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I will tell you why," said Rosamond: "in the first place, Mr.
      Gresham has a large fortune, and I have none. And I have the greatest
      horror of the idea of marrying for money, or of the possibility of its
      being suspected that I might do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought that was the fear!" cried Caroline: "but, my dear Rosamond,
      with your generous mind, you know it is quite impossible that you should
      marry from interested motives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely impossible," said her mother. "And when you are sure of your
      own mind, it would be weakness, my dear, to dread the suspicions of
      others, even if such were likely to be formed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! do not, my dearest Rosamond," said Caroline, taking her sister's
      hand, pressing it between hers, and speaking in the most urgent, almost
      supplicating tone, "do not, generous as you are, sacrifice your happiness
      to mistaken delicacy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Rosamond, after a moment's silence, "but you attribute more
      than I deserve to my delicacy and generosity: I ought not to let you think
      me so much better than I really am. I had some other motives: you will
      think them very foolish&mdash;very ridiculous&mdash;perhaps wrong; but you
      are so kind and indulgent to me, mother, that I will tell you all my
      follies. I do not like to marry a man who is not a hero&mdash;you are very
      good not to laugh, Caroline."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I am too seriously interested at present to laugh," said
      Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you must be sensible," continued Rosamond, "that I could not, by any
      effort of imagination, or by any illusion of love, convert a man of Mr.
      Gresham's time of life and appearance, with his wig, and sober kind of
      understanding, into a hero."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to the wig," replied Mrs. Percy, "you will recollect that both Sir
      Charles Grandison and Lovelace wore wigs; but, my dear, granting that a
      man cannot, in these days, be a hero in a wig, and granting that a hero
      cannot or should not have a sober understanding, will you give me leave to
      ask, whether you have positively determined that none but heroes and
      heroines should live, or love, or marry, or be happy in this mortal
      world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forbid!" said Rosamond, "particularly as I am not a heroine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as only a few hundred millions of people in the world are in the same
      condition," added Mrs. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And those perhaps, not the least happy of human beings," said Caroline.
      "Be that as it may, I think it cannot be denied that Mr. Gresham has, in a
      high degree, one of the qualities which ought to distinguish a hero."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said Rosamond, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Generosity," replied Caroline; "and his large fortune puts it in his
      power to show that quality upon a scale more extended than is usually
      allowed even to the heroes of romance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True&mdash;very true," said Rosamond, smiling: "generosity might make a
      hero of him if he were not a merchant&mdash;a merchant!&mdash;a Percy
      ought not to marry a merchant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, my dear," said Mrs. Percy, "you don't know that half, at least,
      of all the nobility in England have married into the families of
      merchants; therefore, in the opinion of half the nobility of England,
      there can be nothing discreditable or derogatory in such an alliance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, ma'am, such things are; but then you will allow they are usually
      done for money, and that makes the matter worse. If the sons of noble
      families marry the daughters of mercantile houses, it is merely to repair
      the family fortune. But a nobleman has great privileges. If he marry
      beneath himself, his low wife is immediately raised by her wedding-ring to
      an equality with the high and mighty husband&mdash;her name is forgotten
      in her title&mdash;her vulgar relations are left in convenient obscurity:
      the husband never thinks of taking notice of them; and the wife, of
      course, may let it alone if she pleases. But a woman, in our rank of life,
      must bear her husband's name, and must also bear all his relations, be
      they ever so vulgar. Now, Caroline, honestly&mdash;how should you like
      this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honestly, not at all," said Caroline; "but as we cannot have every thing
      we like, or avoid every thing we dislike, in life, we must balance the
      good against the evil, when we are to make our choice: and if I found
      certain amiable, estimable qualities in a character, I think that I might
      esteem, love, and marry him, even though he had a vulgar name and vulgar
      connexions. I fairly acknowledge, however, that it must be something
      superior in the man's character which could balance the objection to
      vulgarity in my mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, my dear," said Rosamond, "do you be a martyr to vulgarity and
      philosophy, if you like it&mdash;but excuse me, if you please. Since you,
      who have so much strength of mind, fairly acknowledge that this objection
      is barely to be overcome by your utmost efforts, do me the favour, do me
      the justice, not to expect from me a degree of civil courage quite above
      my powers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline, still believing that Rosamond was only bringing forward all the
      objections that might be raised against her wishes, replied, "Fortunately,
      my dear Rosamond, you are not called upon for any such effort of
      philosophy, for Mr. Gresham is not vulgar, nor is even his name vulgar,
      and he cannot have any vulgar relations, because he has no relations of
      any description&mdash;I heard him say, the other day, that he was a
      solitary being."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a comfort," said Rosamond, laughing; "that is a great thing in
      his favour; but if he has not relations, he has connexions. What do you
      think of those horrible Pantons? This instant I think I see old Panton
      cooling himself&mdash;wig pushed back&mdash;waistcoat unbuttoned&mdash;and
      protuberant Mrs. Panton with her bay wig and artificial flowers. And not
      the Pantons only, but you may be sure there are hordes of St. Mary Axe
      cockneys, that would pour forth upon <i>Mrs. Gresham</i>, with
      overwhelming force, and with partnership and old-acquaintance-sake claims
      upon her public notice and private intimacy. Come, come, my dear Caroline,
      don't speak against your conscience&mdash;you know you never could
      withstand the hordes of <i>vulgarians</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These vulgarians in buckram," said Caroline, "have grown from two to two
      hundred in a trice, in your imagination, Rosamond: but consider that old
      Panton, against whom you have such an invincible horror, will, now that he
      has quarrelled with Erasmus, probably very soon eat himself out of the
      world; and I don't see that you are bound to Mr. Gresham's dead partner's
      widow&mdash;is this your only objection to Mr. Gresham?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My only objection! Oh, no! don't flatter yourself that in killing old
      Panton you have struck off all my objections. Independently of vulgar
      relations or connexions, and the disparity of age, my grand objection
      remains. But I will address myself to my mother, for you are not a good
      person for judging of prejudices&mdash;you really don't understand them,
      my dear Caroline; one might as well talk to Socrates. You go to work with
      logic, and get one between the horns of a wicked dilemma directly&mdash;I
      will talk to my mother; she understands prejudices."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mother thanks you," said Mrs. Percy, smiling, "for your opinion of
      her understanding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother is the most indulgent of mothers, and, besides, the most
      candid, and therefore I know she will confess to me that she herself
      cherishes a little darling prejudice in favour of birth and family, a <i>leetle</i>
      prejudice&mdash;well covered by good-nature and politeness&mdash;but still
      a secret, invincible antipathy to low-born people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To low-bred people, I grant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother! you are <i>upon your candour</i>&mdash;my dear mother, not
      only low-bred but low-born: confess you have a&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;an
      <i>indisposition</i> towards low-born people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since you put me upon my candour," said Mrs. Percy, "I am afraid I must
      confess that I am conscious of a little of the aristocratic weakness you
      impute to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impute!&mdash;No imputation, in my opinion," cried Rosamond. "I do not
      think it any weakness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I do," said Mrs. Percy&mdash;"I consider it as a weakness; and
      bitterly should I reproach myself, if I saw any weakness, any prejudice of
      mine, influence my children injuriously in the most material circumstance
      of their lives, and where their happiness is at stake. So, my dear
      Rosamond, let me intreat&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! mother, don't let the tears come into your eyes; and, without any
      intreaties, I will do just as you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My love," said Mrs. Percy, "I have no pleasure but that you should please
      yourself and judge for yourself, without referring to any prepossession of
      mine. And lest your imagination should deceive you as to the extent of my
      aristocratic prejudices, let me explain. The <i>indisposition</i>, which I
      have acknowledged I feel towards low-born people, arises, I believe,
      chiefly from my taking it for granted that they cannot be thoroughly
      well-bred. I have accidentally seen examples of people of inferior birth,
      who, though they had risen to high station, and though they had acquired,
      in a certain degree, polite manners, and had been metamorphosed by
      fashion, to all outward appearance, into perfect gentry, yet betrayed some
      marks of their origin, or of their early education, whenever their
      passions or their interests were touched: then some awkward gesture, some
      vulgar expression, some mean or mercenary sentiment, some habitual
      contraction of mind, recurred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, true, most true!" said Rosamond. "It requires two generations, at
      least, to wash out the stain of vulgarity: neither a gentleman nor a
      gentlewoman can be made in less than two generations; therefore I never
      will marry a low-born man, if he had every perfection under the sun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, my dear, that is too strong," said Mrs. Percy. "Hear me, my dearest
      Rosamond. I was going to tell you, that my experience has been so limited,
      that I am not justified in drawing from it any general conclusion. And
      even to the most positive and rational general rules you know there are
      exceptions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a fine general softening clause," said Rosamond; "but now
      positively, mother, would you have ever consented to marry a merchant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, my dear, if your father bad been a merchant, I should have
      married him," replied Mrs. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I except my father. To put the question more fairly, may I ask, do
      you wish that your daughter should marry a merchant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I endeavoured to explain to you before, <i>that</i> depends entirely
      upon what the merchant is, and upon what my daughter feels for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to observe, that merchants are now quite in a different class
      from what they were at the first rise of commerce in these countries,"
      continued her mother. "Their education, their habits of thinking,
      knowledge, and manners, are improved, and, consequently, their <i>consideration</i>,
      their rank in society is raised. In our days, some of the best informed,
      most liberal, and most respectable men in the British dominions are
      merchants. I could not therefore object to my daughter's marrying a
      merchant; but I should certainly inquire anxiously what sort of a merchant
      he was. I do not mean that I should inquire whether he was concerned in
      this or that branch of commerce, but whether his mind were free from every
      thing mercenary and illiberal. I have done so with respect to Mr. Gresham,
      and I can assure you solemnly, that Mr. Gresham's want of the advantage of
      high birth is completely counterbalanced in my opinion by his superior
      qualities. I see in him a cultivated, enlarged, generous mind. I have seen
      him tried, where his passions and his interests have been nearly
      concerned, and I never saw in him the slightest tincture of vulgarity in
      manner or sentiment: therefore, my dear daughter, if he has made an
      impression on your heart, do not, on my account, conceal or struggle
      against it; because, far from objecting to Mr. Gresham for a son-in-law, I
      should prefer him to any gentleman or nobleman who had not his exalted
      character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" cried Caroline, with a look of joyful triumph, "there! my dear
      Rosamond, now your heart must be quite at ease!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But looking at Rosamond at this moment, she saw no expression of joy or
      pleasure in her countenance; and Caroline was now convinced that she had
      been mistaken about Rosamond's feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really and truly, mother, you think all this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really and truly, my dear, no motive upon earth would make me disguise my
      opinions, or palliate even my prejudices, when you thus consult me, and
      depend upon my truth. And now that I have said this much, I will say no
      more, lest I should bias you on the other side: I will leave you to your
      own feelings and excellent understanding."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond's affectionate heart was touched so by her mother's kindness,
      that she could not for some minutes repress her tears. When she recovered
      her voice, she assured her mother and Caroline, with a seriousness and an
      earnest frankness which at once convinced them of her truth, that she had
      not the slightest partiality for Mr. Gresham; that, on the contrary, his
      age was to her a serious objection. She had feared that her friends might
      wish for the match, and that being conscious she had no other objection to
      make to Mr. Gresham except that she could not love him, she had hesitated
      for want of a better reason, when her mother first began this
      cross-examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relieved by this thorough explanation, and by the conviction that her
      father, mother, and sister, were perfectly satisfied with her decision,
      Rosamond was at ease as far as she herself was concerned. But she still
      dreaded to see Mr. Gresham again. She was excessively sorry to have given
      him pain, and she feared not a little that in rejecting the lover she
      should lose the friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gresham, however, was of too generous a character to cease to be the
      friend of the woman he loved, merely because she could not return his
      passion: it is wounded pride, not disappointed affection, that turns
      immediately from love to hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond was spared the pain of seeing Mr. Gresham again at this time, for
      he left the Hills, and set out immediately for London, where he was
      recalled by news of the sudden death of his partner. Old Mr. Panton had
      been found dead in his bed, after having supped inordinately the preceding
      night upon eel-pie. It was indispensably necessary that Mr. Gresham should
      attend at the opening of Panton's will, and Mrs. Panton wrote to represent
      this in urgent terms. Mr. Henry was gone to Amsterdam; he had, for some
      time previously to the death of Mr. Panton, obtained the partnership's
      permission to go over to the Dutch merchants, their correspondents in
      Amsterdam, to fill a situation in their house, for which his knowledge of
      the Dutch, French, and Spanish languages eminently qualified him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Henry had solicited this employment, Mr. Gresham had been
      unwilling to part with him, but had yielded to the young man's earnest
      entreaties, and to the idea that this change would, in a lucrative point
      of view, be materially for Mr. Henry's advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some apology to the lovers of romance may be expected for this abrupt
      transition from the affairs of the heart to the affairs of the
      counting-house&mdash;but so it is in real life. We are sorry, but we
      cannot help it&mdash;we have neither sentiments nor sonnets, ready for
      every occasion.

      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      LETTER FROM ALFRED.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>This appears to have been written some months after the vacation spent
      at the Hills</i>.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Oh! thoughtless mortals, ever blind to fate,
  Too soon dejected, and too soon elate.'
</pre>
    <p>
      "You remember, I am sure, my dear father, how angry we were some time ago
      with that man, whose name I never would tell you, the man whom Rosamond
      called Counsellor <i>Nameless</i>, who snatched a <i>good point</i> from
      me in arguing Mr. Hauton's cause. This very circumstance has been the
      means of introducing me to the notice of three men, all eminent in their
      profession, and each with the same inclination to serve me, according to
      their respective powers&mdash;a solicitor, a barrister, and a judge.
      Solicitor Babington (by-the-by, pray tell Rosamond in answer to her
      question whether there is an honest attorney, that there are no such
      things as <i>attorneys</i> now in England&mdash;they are all turned into
      solicitors and agents, just as every <i>shop</i> is become a <i>warehouse</i>,
      and every <i>service</i> a <i>situation</i>), Babington the solicitor
      employed against us in that suit a man who knows, without practising them,
      all the tricks of the trade, and who is a thoroughly honest man. He saw
      the trick that was played by <i>Nameless</i>, and took occasion afterwards
      to recommend me to several of his own clients. Upon the strength of this
      <i>point</i> briefs appeared on my table day after day&mdash;two guineas,
      three guineas, five guineas! comfortable sight! But far more comfortable,
      more gratifying, the kindness of Counsellor Friend: a more benevolent man
      never existed. I am sure the profession of the law has not contracted his
      heart, and yet you never saw or can conceive a man more intent upon his
      business. I believe he eats, drinks, and sleeps upon law: he has the
      reputation, in consequence, of being one of the soundest of our lawyers&mdash;the
      best opinion in England. He seems to make the cause of every client his
      own, and is as anxious as if his private property depended on the fate of
      each suit. He sets me a fine example of labour, perseverance, professional
      enthusiasm and rectitude. He is one of the very best friends a young
      lawyer like me could have; he puts me in the way I should go, and keeps me
      in it by showing that it is not a matter of chance, but of certainty, that
      this is the right road to fortune and to fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Friend has sometimes a way of paying a compliment as if he were
      making a reproach, and of doing a favour as a matter of course. Just now I
      met him, and apropos to some observations I happened to make on a cause in
      which he is engaged, he said to me, as if he were half angry, though I
      knew he was thoroughly pleased, 'Quick parts! Yes, so I see you have: but
      take care&mdash;in your profession 'tis often "Most haste, worst speed;"
      not but what there are happy exceptions, examples of lawyers, who have
      combined judgment with wit, industry with genius, and law with eloquence.
      But these instances are rare, very rare; for the rarity of the case, worth
      studying. Therefore dine with me to-morrow, and I will introduce you to
      one of these exceptions.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The person in question, I opine, is the lord chief justice&mdash;and
      Friend could not do me a greater favour than to introduce me to one whom,
      as you know, I have long admired in public, and with whom, independently
      of any professional advantage, I have ardently wished to be acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been told&mdash;I cannot tell you what&mdash;for here's the
      bell-man. I don't wonder 'the choleric man' knocked down the postman for
      blowing his horn in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abruptly yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      "ALFRED PERCY."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred had good reason to desire to be acquainted with this lord chief
      justice. Some French writer says, "<i>Qu'il faut plier les grandes ailes
      de l'éloquence pour entrer dans un salon.</i>" The chief justice did so
      with peculiar ease. He possessed perfect conversational <i>tact</i>, with
      great powers of wit, humour, and all that felicity of allusion, which an
      uncommonly recollective memory, acting on stores of varied knowledge, can
      alone command. He really conversed; he did not merely tell stories, or
      make bonmots, or confine himself to the single combat of close argument,
      or the flourish of declamation; but he alternately followed and led, threw
      out and received ideas, knowing how to listen full as well as how to talk,
      remembering always Lord Chesterfield's experienced maxim, "That it is
      easier to hear than to talk yourself into the good opinion of your
      auditors." It was not, however, from policy, but from benevolence, that
      the chief justice made so good a hearer. It has been said, and with truth,
      that with him a <i>good point</i> never passed unnoticed in a public
      court, nor was a <i>good thing</i> ever lost upon him in private company.
      Of the number of his own good things fewer are in circulation than might
      be expected. The best conversation, that which rises from the occasion,
      and which suits the moment, suffers most from repetition. Fitted precisely
      to the peculiar time and place, the best things cannot bear transplanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day Alfred Percy was introduced to the chief justice, the conversation
      began, from some slight remarks made by one of the company, on the acting
      of Mrs. Siddons. A lady who had just been reading the memoirs of the
      celebrated French actress, Mademoiselle Clairon, spoke of the astonishing
      pains which she took to study her parts, and to acquire what the French
      call <i>l'air noble</i>, continually endeavouring, on the most common
      occasions, when she was off the stage, to avoid all awkward motions, and
      in her habitual manner to preserve an air of grace and dignity. This led
      the chief justice to mention the care which Lord Chatham, Mr. Pitt, and
      other great orators, have taken to form their habits of speaking, by
      unremitting attention to their language in private as well as in public.
      He maintained that no man <i>can</i> speak with ease and security in
      public till custom has brought him to feel it as a moral impossibility
      that he could be guilty of any petty vulgarism, or that he could be
      convicted of any capital sin against grammar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred felt anxious to hear the chief justice farther on this subject, but
      the conversation was dragged back to Mademoiselle Clairon. The lady by
      whom she was first mentioned declared she thought that all Mademoiselle
      Clairon's studying must have made her a very unnatural actress. The chief
      justice quoted the answer which Mademoiselle Clairon gave, when she was
      reproached with having too much art.&mdash;"<i>De l'art! et que
      voudroit-on done que j'eusse? Etois-je Andromaque? Etois-je Phédre?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred observed that those who complained of an actress's having too much
      art should rather complain of her having too little&mdash;of her not
      having art enough to conceal her art.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief justice honoured Alfred by a nod and a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, however, protested against this doctrine, and concluded by
      confessing that she always did and always should prefer nature to art.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this commonplace confession, the chief justice, by a playful
      cross-examination, presently made it apparent that we do not always know
      what we mean by art and what by nature; that the ideas are so mixed in
      civilized society, and the words so inaccurately used, both in common
      conversation, and in the writings of philosophers, that no metaphysical
      prism can separate or reduce them to their primary meaning. Next he
      touched upon the distinction between art and artifice. The conversation
      branched out into remarks on grace and affectation, and thence to the
      different theories of beauty and taste, with all which he <i>played</i>
      with a master's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man accustomed to speak to numbers perceives immediately when his
      auditors seize his ideas, and knows instantly, by the assent and
      expression of the eye, to whom they are new or to whom they are familiar.
      The chief justice discovered that Alfred Percy had superior knowledge,
      literature, and talents, even before he spoke, by his manner of listening.
      The conversation presently passed from <i>l'air noble</i> to <i>le style
      noble</i>, and to the French laws of criticism, which prohibit the
      descending to allusions to arts and manufactures. This subject he
      discussed deeply, yet rapidly observed how taste is influenced by
      different governments and manners&mdash;remarked how the strong line of
      demarcation formerly kept in France between the nobility and the citizens
      had influenced taste in writing and in eloquence, and how our more <i>popular</i>
      government not only admitted allusions to the occupations of the lower
      classes, but required them. Our orators at elections, and in parliament,
      must speak so as to come home to the feelings and vocabulary of
      constituents. Examples from Burke and others, the chief justice said,
      might be brought in support of this opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred was so fortunate as to recollect some apposite illustrations from
      Burke, and from several of our great orators, Wyndham, Erskine,
      Mackintosh, and Romilly. As Alfred spoke, the chief justice's eye
      brightened with approbation, and it was observed that he afterwards
      addressed to him particularly his conversation; and, more flattering
      still, that he went deeper into the subject which he had been discussing.
      From one of the passages which had been mentioned, he took occasion to
      answer the argument of the French critics, who justify their taste by
      asserting that it is the taste of the ancients. Skilled in classical as in
      modern literature, he showed that the ancients had made allusions to arts
      and manufactures, as far as their knowledge went; but, as he observed, in
      modern times new arts and sciences afford fresh subjects of allusion
      unknown to the ancients; consequently we ought not to restrict our taste
      by exclusive reverence for classical precedents. On these points it is
      requisite to reform the pandects of criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another passage from Burke, to which Alfred had alluded, the chief justice
      thought too rich in ornament. "Ornaments," he said, "if not kept
      subordinate, however intrinsically beautiful, injure the general effect&mdash;therefore
      a judicious orator will sacrifice all such as draw the attention from his
      principal design."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred Percy, in support of this opinion, cited the example of the Spanish
      painter, who obliterated certain beautiful silver vases, which he had
      introduced in a picture of the Lord's Supper, because he found, that at
      first view, every spectator's eye was caught by these splendid ornaments,
      and every one extolled their exquisite finish, instead of attending to the
      great subject of the piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief justice was so well pleased with the conversation of our young
      barrister, that, at parting, he gave Alfred an invitation to his house.
      The conversation had been very different from what might have been
      expected: metaphysics, belles-lettres, poetry, plays, criticism&mdash;what
      a range of ideas, far from Coke and Selden, was gone over this evening in
      the course of a few hours! Alfred had reason to be more and more convinced
      of the truth of his father's favourite doctrine, that the general
      cultivation of the understanding, and the acquirement of general
      knowledge, are essential to the attainment of excellence in any
      profession, useful to a young man particularly in introducing him to the
      notice of valuable friends and acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      An author well skilled in the worst parts of human nature has asserted,
      that "nothing is more tiresome than praises in which we have no manner of
      share." Yet we, who have a better opinion of our kind, trust that there
      are some who can sympathize in the enthusiasm of a good and young mind,
      struck with splendid talents, and with a superior character; therefore we
      venture to insert some of the warm eulogiums, with which we find our young
      lawyer's letters filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My DEAR FATHER,

    <p>
      "I have only a few moments to write, but cannot delay to answer your
      question about the chief justice. <i>Disappointed</i>&mdash;no danger of
      that&mdash;he far surpasses my expectations. It has been said that he
      never opened a book, that he never heard a common ballad, or saw a workman
      at his trade, without learning something, which he afterwards turned to
      good account. This you may see in his public speeches, but I am more
      completely convinced of it since I have heard him converse. His
      illustrations are drawn from the workshop, the manufactory, the mine, the
      mechanic, the poet&mdash;from every art and science, from every thing in
      nature, animate or inanimate.

      In a subsequent letter he shows that his admiration increased instead of
      diminishing, upon a more intimate acquaintance with its object.
    </p>
    <p>
      "High station," says Alfred, "appears to me much more desirable, since I
      have known this great man. He makes rank so gracious, and shows that it is
      a pleasurable, not a 'painful pre-eminence,' when it gives the power of
      raising others, and of continually doing kind and generous actions. Mr.
      Friend tells me, that, before the chief justice was so high as he is now,
      without a rival in his profession, he was ever the most generous man to
      his competitors. I am sure he is now the most kind and condescending to
      his inferiors. In company he is never intent upon himself, seems never
      anxious about his own dignity or his own fame. He is sufficiently sure of
      both to be quite at ease. He excites my ambition, and exalts its nature
      and value.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has raised my esteem for my profession, by showing the noble use that
      can be made of it, in defending right and virtue. He has done my mind good
      in another way: he has shown me that professional labour is not
      incompatible with domestic pleasures. I wish you could see him as I do, in
      the midst of his family, with his fine children playing about him, with
      his wife, a charming cultivated woman, who adores him, and who is his best
      companion and friend. Before I knew the chief justice, I had seen other
      great lawyers and judges, some of them crabbed old bachelors, others
      uneasily yoked to vulgar helpmates&mdash;having married early in life
      women whom they had dragged up as they rose, but who were always pulling
      them down&mdash;had seen some of these learned men sink into mere
      epicures, and become dead to intellectual enjoyment&mdash;others, with
      higher minds, and originally fine talents, I had seen in premature old
      age, with understandings contracted and palsied by partial or overstrained
      exertion, worn out, mind and body, and only late, very late in life, just
      attaining wealth and honours, when they were incapable of enjoying them.
      This had struck me as a deplorable and discouraging spectacle&mdash;a sad
      termination of a life of labour. But now I see a man in the prime of life,
      in the full vigour of all his intellectual faculties and moral
      sensibility, with a high character, fortune, and professional honours, all
      obtained by his own merit and exertions, with the prospect of health and
      length of days to enjoy and communicate happiness. Exulting in the sight
      of this resplendent luminary, and conscious that it will guide and cheer
      me forwards, I 'bless the useful light.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Our young lawyer was so honestly enthusiastic in his admiration of this
      great man, and was so full of the impression that had been made on his
      mind, that he forgot in this letter to advert to the advantage which, in a
      professional point of view, he might derive from the good opinion formed
      of him by the chief justice. In consequence of Solicitor Babington's
      telling his clients the share which Alfred had in winning Colonel Hauton's
      cause, he was employed in a suit of considerable importance, in which a
      great landed property was at stake. It was one of those standing suits
      which last from year to year, and which seem likely to linger on from
      generation to generation. Instead of considering his brief in this cause
      merely as a means of obtaining a fee, instead of contenting himself to
      make some <i>motion of course</i>, which fell to his share, Alfred set
      himself seriously to study the case, and searched indefatigably for all
      the precedents that could bear upon it. He was fortunate enough, or rather
      he was persevering enough, to find an old case in point, which had escaped
      the attention of the other lawyers. Mr. Friend was one of the senior
      counsel in this cause, and he took generous care that Alfred's merit
      should not now, as upon a former occasion, he concealed. Mr. Friend
      prevailed upon his brother barristers to agree in calling upon Alfred to
      speak to his own <i>case in point</i>; and the chief justice, who
      presided, said, "This case is new to me. This had escaped me, Mr. Percy; I
      must take another day to reconsider the matter, before I can pronounce
      judgment."
    </p>
    <p>
      This from the chief justice, with the sense which Alfred's brother
      barristers felt of his deserving such notice, was of immediate and
      material advantage to our young lawyer. Attorneys and solicitors turned
      their eyes upon him, briefs began to flow in, and his diligence increased
      with his business. As junior counsel, he still had little opportunity in
      the common course of things of distinguishing himself, as it frequently
      fell to his share only to say a few words; but he never failed to make
      himself master of every case in which he was employed. And it happened one
      day, when the senior counsel was ill, the judge called upon the next
      barrister.&mdash;"Mr. Trevors, are you prepared?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord&mdash;I can't say&mdash;no, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Percy, are you prepared?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I thought&mdash;always prepared: go on, sir&mdash;go on, Mr. Percy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on, and spoke so ably, and with such comprehensive knowledge of
      the case and of the law, that he obtained a decision in favour of his
      client, and established his own reputation as a man of business and of
      talents, who was <i>always prepared</i>. For the manner in which he was
      brought forward and distinguished by the chief justice he was truly
      grateful. This was a species of patronage honourable both to the giver and
      the receiver. Here was no favour shown disproportionate to deserts, but
      here was just distinction paid to merit, and generous discernment giving
      talents opportunity of developing themselves. These opportunities would
      only have been the ruin of a man who could not show himself equal to the
      occasion; but this was not the case with Alfred. His capacity, like the
      fairy tent, seemed to enlarge so as to contain all that it was necessary
      to comprehend: and new powers appeared in him in new situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred had been introduced by his brother Erasmus to some of those men of
      literature with whom he had become acquainted at Lady Spilsbury's good
      dinners. Among these was a Mr. Dunbar, a gentleman who had resided for
      many years in India, from whom Alfred, who constantly sought for
      information from all with whom he conversed, had learned much of Indian
      affairs. Mr. Dunbar had collected some curious tracts on Mohammedan law,
      and glad to find an intelligent auditor on his favourite subject, a
      subject not generally interesting, he willingly communicated all he knew
      to Alfred, and lent him his manuscripts and scarce tracts, which Alfred,
      in the many leisure hours that a young lawyer can command before he gets
      into practice, had studied, and of which he had made himself master. It
      happened a considerable time afterwards that the East India Company had a
      cause&mdash;one of the greatest causes ever brought before our courts of
      law&mdash;relative to the demand of some native bankers in Hindostan
      against the company for upwards of four millions of rupees. This Mr.
      Dunbar, who had a considerable interest in the cause, and who was intimate
      with several of the directors, recommended it to them to employ Mr. Alfred
      Percy, who, as he knew, had had ample means of information, and who had
      studied a subject of which few of his brother barristers had any
      knowledge. The very circumstance of his being employed in a cause of such
      importance was of great advantage to him; and the credit he gained by
      accurate and uncommon knowledge in the course of the suit at once raised
      his reputation among the best judges, and <i>established</i> him in the
      courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion, Alfred's moral character was as serviceable as his
      literary taste had been in recommending him to his clients. Buckhurst
      Falconer had introduced him to a certain Mr. Clay, known by the name of <i>French</i>
      Clay. In a conversation after dinner, when the ladies had retired, Mr.
      Clay had boasted of his successes with the fair sex, and had expressed
      many sentiments that marked him for a profligate coxcomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred felt disgust and indignation for this parade of vice. There was one
      officer in company who strongly sympathized in his feelings; this led to
      farther acquaintance and mutual esteem. This officer soon afterwards
      married Lady Harriet &mdash;&mdash;, a beautiful young woman, with whom he
      lived happily for some time, till, unfortunately, while her husband was
      abroad with his regiment, chance brought the wife, at a watering-place,
      into the company of French Clay, and imprudence, the love of flattery,
      coquetry, and self-confidence, made her a victim to his vanity. Love he
      had none&mdash;nor she either&mdash;but her disgrace was soon discovered,
      or revealed; and her unhappy and almost distracted husband immediately
      commenced a suit against Clay. He chose Alfred Percy for his counsel. In
      this cause, where strong feelings of indignation were justly roused, and
      where there was room for oratory, Alfred spoke with such force and pathos
      that every honest heart was touched. The verdict of the jury showed the
      impression which he had made upon them: his speech was universally
      admired; and those who had till now known him only as a man of business,
      and a sound lawyer, were surprised to find him suddenly display such
      powers of eloquence. Counsellor Friend's plain advice to him had always
      been, "Never harangue about nothing: if your client require it, he is a
      fool, and never mind him; never speak till you've something to say, and
      then only say what you have to say.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Words are like leaves, and where they most abound,
  Much fruit of solid sense is seldom found.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      Friend now congratulated Alfred with all his honest affectionate heart,
      and said, with a frown that struggled hard with a smile, "Well, I believe
      I must allow you to be an orator. But, take care&mdash;don't let the
      lawyer merge in the advocate. Bear it always in mind, that a mere man of
      words at the bar&mdash;or indeed any where else&mdash;is a mere man of
      straw."
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief justice, who knew how to say the kindest things in the most
      polite manner, was heard to observe, that "Mr. Percy had done wisely, to
      begin by showing that he had laid a solid foundation of law, on which the
      ornaments of oratory could be raised high, and supported securely."
    </p>
    <p>
      French Clay's <i>affair</i> with Lady Harriot had been much talked of in
      the fashionable world; from a love of scandal or a love of justice, from
      zeal in the cause of morality or from natural curiosity, her trial had
      been a matter of general interest to the ladies, young and old. In
      consequence Mr. Alfred Percy's speech was <i>prodigiously</i> read, and,
      from various motives, highly applauded. When a man begins to rise, all
      hands&mdash;all hands but the hands of his rivals&mdash;are ready to push
      him up, and all tongues exclaim, "'Twas I helped!" or, "'Twas what I
      always foretold!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Angelica Headingham now bethought herself that she had a little
      poem, written by Mr. Alfred Percy, which had been given to her long ago by
      Miss Percy, and of which, at the time she received it, her ladyship had
      thought so little, that hardly deigning to bestow the customary tribute of
      a compliment, she had thrown it, scarcely perused, into her writing-box.
      It was now worth while to rummage for it, and now, when the author had a
      <i>name</i>, her ladyship discovered that the poem was charming&mdash;absolutely
      charming! Such an early indication of talents! Such a happy promise of
      genius!&mdash;Oh! she had always foreseen that Mr. Alfred Percy would make
      an uncommon figure in the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me! does your ladyship know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! intimately!&mdash;That is, I never saw <i>him</i> exactly&mdash;but
      all his family I've known intimately&mdash;ages ago in the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should so like to meet him! And do pray give me a copy of the verses&mdash;and
      me!&mdash;and me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      To work went the pens of all the female amateurs, in scribbling copies of
      "<i>The Lawyer's May-day</i>."&mdash;And away went the fair patroness in
      search of the author&mdash;introduced herself with unabashed grace,
      invited him for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday&mdash;Engaged? how
      unfortunate!&mdash;Well, for next week? a fortnight hence? three weeks?
      positively she must have him at her conversazione&mdash;she must give him&mdash;No,
      he must give her a day, he must consent to lose a day&mdash;so many of her
      friends and real judges were dying to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To save the lives of so many judges, he consented to lose an evening&mdash;the
      day was fixed&mdash;Alfred found her conversazione very brilliant&mdash;was
      admired&mdash;and admired others in his turn as much as was expected. It
      was an agreeable variety of company and of thought to him, and he promised
      to go sometimes to her ladyship's parties&mdash;a promise which delighted
      her much, particularly as he had not yet given a copy of the verses to
      Lady Spilsbury. Lady Spilsbury, to whom the verses quickly worked round,
      was quite angry that her friend Erasmus had not given her an early copy;
      and now invitations the most pressing came from Lady Spilsbury to her
      excellent literary dinners. If Alfred had been so disposed, he might,
      among these fetchers and carriers of bays, have been extolled to the
      skies; but he had too much sense and prudence to lose the substance for
      the shadow, to sink a solid character into a <i>drawing-room reputation</i>.
      Of this he had seen the folly in Buckhurst Falconer's case, and now, if
      any farther warning on this subject had been wanting, he would have taken
      it from the example of <i>poor</i> Seebright, the poet, whom he met the
      second time he went to Lady Angelica Headingham's. <i>Poor Seebright</i>,
      as the world already began to call him, from being an object of
      admiration, was beginning to sink into an object of pity. Instead of
      making himself independent by steady exertions in any respectable
      profession, instead of making his way in the republic of letters by some
      solid work of merit, he frittered away his time among fashionable
      amateurs, feeding upon their flattery, and living on in the vain hope of
      patronage. Already the flight of his genius had been restrained, the force
      of his wing impaired; instead of soaring superior, he kept hovering near
      the earth; his "kestrel courage fell," he appeared to be almost tamed to
      the domestic state to which he was reduced&mdash;yet now and then a rebel
      sense of his former freedom, and of his present degradation, would appear.
      "Ah! if I were but independent as you are! If I had but followed a
      profession as you have done!" said he to Alfred, when, apart from the
      crowd, they had an opportunity of conversing confidentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred replied that it was not yet too late, that it was never too late
      for a man of spirit and talents to make himself independent; he then
      suggested to Mr. Seebright various ways of employing his powers, and
      pointed out some useful and creditable literary undertakings, by which he
      might acquire reputation. Seebright listened, his eye eagerly catching at
      each new idea the first moment, the next turning off to something else,
      raising objections futile or fastidious, seeing nothing impossible in any
      dream of his imagination, where no effort of exertion was requisite, but
      finding every thing impracticable when he came to sober reality, where he
      was called upon to labour. In fact, he was one of the sort of people who
      do not know what they want, or what they would be, who complain and
      complain; disappointed and discontented, at having sunk below their powers
      and their hopes, and are yet without capability of persevering exertion to
      emerge from their obscurity. Seebright was now become an inefficient
      being, whom no one could assist to any good purpose. Alfred, after a long,
      mazy, fruitless conversation, was convinced that the case was hopeless,
      and, sincerely pitying him, gave it up as irremediable. Just as he had
      come to this conclusion, and had sunk into silence, a relation of his,
      whom he had not seen for a considerable time, entered the room, and passed
      by without noticing him. She was so much altered in her appearance, that
      he could scarcely believe he saw Lady Jane Granville; she looked out of
      spirits, and care-worn. He immediately observed that less attention was
      paid to her than she used to command; she had obviously sunk considerably
      in importance, and appeared to feel this keenly. Upon inquiry, Alfred
      learnt that she had lost a large portion of her fortune by a lawsuit,
      which she had managed, that is to say, mismanaged, for herself; and she
      was still at law for the remainder of her estate, which, notwithstanding
      her right was undoubted, it was generally supposed that she would lose,
      for the same reason that occasioned her former failure, her pertinacity in
      following her own advice only. Alfred knew that there had been some
      misunderstanding between Lady Jane and his family, that she had been
      offended by his sister Caroline having declined accepting her invitation
      to town, and from Mr. and Mrs. Percy having differed with her in opinion
      as to the value of the <i>patronage</i> of fashion: she had also been
      displeased with Erasmus about Sir Amyas Courtney. Notwithstanding all
      this, he was convinced that Lady Jane, whatever her opinions might be, and
      whether mistaken or not, had been actuated by sincere regard for his
      family, for which he and they were grateful; and now was the time to show
      it, now when he was coming into notice in the world, and she declining in
      importance. Therefore, though she had passed by him without recognizing
      him, he went immediately and spoke to her in so respectful and kind a
      manner, paid her the whole evening such marked attention, that she was
      quite pleased and touched. In reality, she had been vexed with herself for
      having persisted so long in her resentment; she wished for a fair
      opportunity for a reconciliation, and she rejoiced that Alfred thus opened
      the way for it. She invited him to come to see her the next day,
      observing, as she put her card into his hand, that she no longer lived in
      her fine house in St. James's place. Now that his motives could not be
      mistaken, he was assiduous in his visits; and when he had sufficiently
      obtained her confidence, he ventured to touch upon her affairs. She, proud
      to convince him of her abilities as a woman of business, explained her
      whole case, and descanted upon the blunders and folly of her solicitors
      and counsellors, especially upon the absurdity of the opinions which she
      had not followed. Her cause depended upon the <i>replication</i> she was
      to put in to a plea in special pleading: she thought she saw the way
      straight before her, and exclaimed vehemently against that love of the
      crooked path by which her lawyers seemed possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without disputing the legal soundness of her ladyship's opinion in her own
      peculiar case, Alfred, beginning at a great distance from her passions,
      quietly undertook, by relating to her cases which had fallen under his own
      knowledge, to convince her that plain common sense and reason could never
      lead her to the knowledge of the rules of special pleading, or to the
      proper wording of those answers, on the <i>letter</i> of which the fate of
      a cause frequently depends. He confessed to her that his own understanding
      had been so shocked at first by the apparent absurdity of the system, that
      he had almost abandoned the study, and that it had been only in
      consequence of actual experience that he had at last discovered the
      utility of those rules. She insisted upon being also convinced before she
      could submit; but as it is not quite so easy as ladies sometimes think it
      is to teach any art or science in two words, or to convey, in a moment, to
      the ignorant, the combined result of study and experience, Alfred declined
      this task, and could undertake only to show her ladyship, by asking her
      opinion on various cases which had been decided in the courts, that it was
      possible she might be mistaken; and that, however superior her
      understanding, a court of law would infallibly decide according to its own
      rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, good Heavens! my dear sir," exclaimed Lady Jane, "when, after I have
      paid the amount of my bond, and every farthing that I owe a creditor, yet
      this rogue says I have not, is not it a proper answer that I owe him
      nothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, this would be considered as an evasive plea by the court, or
      as a <i>negative pregnant</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! if you come to your <i>negative pregnants</i>," cried Lady Jane, "it
      is impossible to understand you&mdash;I give up the point."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this conclusion it had been Alfred's object to bring her ladyship; and
      when she was fully convinced of the insufficient limits of the human&mdash;he
      never said the female&mdash;understanding to comprehend these things
      without the aid of men learned in the law, he humbly offered his
      assistance to guide her out of that labyrinth, into which, unwittingly and
      without any clue, she had ventured farther and farther, till she was just
      in the very jaws of nonsuit and ruin. She put her affairs completely into
      his hands, and promised that she would no farther interfere, even with her
      advice; for it was upon this condition that Alfred engaged to undertake
      the management of her cause. Nothing indeed is more tormenting to men of
      business, than to be pestered with the incessant advice, hopes and fears,
      cautions and explanations, cunning suggestions, superficial knowledge, and
      profound ignorance, of lady or gentlemen lawyers. Alfred now begged and
      obtained permission from the court to amend the Lady Jane Granville's last
      plea&mdash;he thenceforward conducted the business, and played the game of
      special pleading with such strict and acute attention to the rules, that
      there were good hopes the remaining portion of her ladyship's fortune,
      which was now at stake, might be saved. He endeavoured to keep up her
      spirits and her patience, for of a speedy termination to the business
      there was no chance. They had to deal with adversaries who knew how, on
      their side, to protract the pleadings, and to avoid what is called <i>coming
      to the point</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great pleasure to Alfred thus to have it in his power to assist
      his friends, and the hope of serving them redoubled his diligence. About
      this time he was engaged in a cause for his brother's friend and
      Rosamond's admirer, Mr. Gresham. A picture-dealer had cheated this
      gentleman, in the sale of a picture of considerable value. Mr. Gresham had
      bargained for, and bought, an original Guido, wrote his name on the back
      of it, and directed that it should be sent to him. The painting which was
      taken to his house had his name written on the back, but was not the
      original Guido for which he had bargained&mdash;it was a copy. The
      picture-dealer, however, and two respectable witnesses, were ready to
      swear positively that this was the identical picture on which Mr. Gresham
      wrote his name&mdash;that they saw him write his name, and heard him order
      that it should be sent to him. Mr. Gresham himself acknowledged that the
      writing was so like his own that he could not venture to deny that it was
      his, and yet he could swear that this was not the picture for which he had
      bargained, and on which he had written his name. He suspected it to be a
      forgery; and was certain that, by some means, one picture had been
      substituted for another. Yet the defendant had witnesses to prove that the
      picture never was out of Mr. Gresham's sight, from the time he bargained
      for it, till the moment when he wrote his name on the back, in the
      presence of the same witnesses.

      This chain of evidence they thought was complete, and that it could not be
      broken. Alfred Percy, however, discovered the nature of the fraud, and,
      regardless of the boasts and taunts of the opposite party, kept his mind
      carefully secret, till the moment when he came to cross-examine the
      witnesses; for, as Mr. Friend had observed to him, many a cause had been
      lost by the impatience of counsel, in showing, beforehand, how it might
      certainly be won [Footnote: See Deinology.]. By thus revealing the
      intended mode of attack, opportunity is given to prepare a defence by
      which it may be ultimately counteracted. In the present case, the
      defendant, however, came into court secure of victory, and utterly
      unprepared to meet the truth, which was brought out full upon him when
      least expected. The fact was, that he had put two pictures into the same
      frame&mdash;the original in front, the copy behind it: on the back of the
      canvass of the copy Mr. Gresham had written his name, never suspecting
      that it was not the original for which he bargained, and which he thought
      he actually held in his hand. The witnesses, therefore, swore literally
      the truth, that they saw him write upon <i>that</i> picture; and they
      believed the picture, on which he wrote, was the identical picture that
      was sent home to him. One of the witnesses was an honest man, who really
      believed what he swore, and knew nothing of the fraud, to which the other,
      a rogue in confederacy with the picture-dealer, was privy. The
      cross-examination of both was so ably managed, that the honest man was
      soon made to perceive and the rogue forced to reveal the truth. Alfred had
      reason to be proud of the credit he obtained for the ability displayed in
      this cross-examination, but he was infinitely more gratified by having it
      in his power to gain a cause for his friend, and to restore to Mr. Gresham
      his favourite Guido.

      A welcome sight&mdash;a letter from Godfrey! the first his family had
      received from him since he left England. Two of his letters, it appears,
      had been lost. Alluding to one he had written immediately on hearing of
      the change in his father's fortune, he observes, that he has kept his
      resolution of living within his pay; and, after entering into some other
      family details, he continues as follows: "Now, my dear mother, prepare to
      hear me recant what I have said against Lord Oldborough. I forgive his
      lordship all his sins, and I begin to believe, that though he is a
      statesman, his heart is not yet quite <i>ossified</i>. He has recalled our
      regiment from this unhealthy place, and he has promoted Gascoigne to be
      our lieutenant-colonel. I say that Lord Oldborough has done all this,
      because I am sure, from a hint in Alfred's last letter, that his lordship
      has been the prime mover in the business. But not to keep you in suspense
      about the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my first letter to my father, I told you, that from the moment our
      late lethargic lieutenant-colonel came to the island, he took to drinking
      rum, pure rum, to waken himself&mdash;claret, port, and madeira, had lost
      their power over him. Then came brandy, which he fancied was an excellent
      preservative against the yellow fever, and the fever of the country. So he
      died 'boldly by brandy.' Poor fellow! he was boasting to me, the last week
      of his existence, when he was literally on his deathbed, that his father
      taught him to drink before he was six years old, by practising him every
      day, after dinner, in the sublime art of carrying a bumper steadily to his
      lips. He, moreover, boasted to me, that when a boy of thirteen, at an
      academy, he often drank two bottles of claret at a sitting; and that, when
      he went into the army, getting among a jolly set, he brought himself never
      to feel the worse for any quantity of wine. I don't know what he meant by
      the worse for it&mdash;at forty-five, when I first saw him, he had neither
      head nor hand left for himself or his country. His hand shook so, that if
      he had been perishing with thirst, he could not have carried a glass to
      his lips, till after various attempts in all manner of curves and zigzags,
      spilling half of it by the way. It was really pitiable to see him&mdash;when
      he was to sign his name I always went out of the room, and left Gascoigne
      to guide his hand. More helpless still his mind than his body. If his own
      or England's salvation had depended upon it, he could not, when in the
      least hurried, have uttered a distinct order, have dictated an
      intelligible letter; or, in time of need, have recollected the name of any
      one of his officers, or even his own name&mdash;quite imbecile and
      embruted. But, peace to his ashes&mdash;or rather to his dregs&mdash;and
      may there never be such another British colonel!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Early habits of temperance have not only saved my life, but made my life
      worth saving. Neither Colonel Gascoigne nor I have ever had a day's
      serious illness since we came to the island&mdash;but we are the only two
      that have escaped. Partly from the colonel's example, and partly from
      their own inclination, all the other officers have drunk hard. Lieutenant
      R&mdash;&mdash; is now ill of the fever; Captain H&mdash;&mdash; (I beg
      his pardon), now Major H&mdash;&mdash;, will soon follow the colonel to
      the grave, unless he takes my very disinterested advice, and drinks less.
      I am laughed at by D&mdash;&mdash; and V&mdash;&mdash;and others for this;
      they ask why the deuce I can't let the major kill himself his own way, and
      as fast as he pleases, when I should get on a step by it, and that step
      such a great one. They say none but a fool would do as I do, and I think
      none but a brute could do otherwise&mdash;I can't stand by with any
      satisfaction, and see a fellow- creature killing himself by inches, even
      though I have the chance of slipping into his shoes: I am sure the shoes
      would pinch me confoundedly. If it is my brother-officer's lot to fall in
      battle&mdash;it's very well&mdash;I run the same hazard&mdash;he dies, as
      he ought to do, a brave fellow; but to stand by, and see a man die as he
      ought not to do, and die what is called an <i>honest fellow</i>!&mdash;I
      can't do it. H&mdash;&mdash; at first had a great mind to run me through
      the body; but, poor man, he is now very fond of me, and if any one can
      keep him from destroying himself, I flatter myself I shall.
    </p>

      "A thousand thanks to dear Caroline for her letter, and to Rosamond for
      her journal. They, who have never been an inch from home, cannot conceive
      how delightful it is, at such a distance, to receive letters from our
      friends. You remember, in Cook's voyage, his joy at meeting in some
      distant island with the spoon marked <i>London</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you received my letters, Nos. I and 2. Not that there was any
      thing particular in them. You know I never do more than tell the bare
      facts&mdash;not like Rosamond's journal&mdash;with which, by-the-bye,
      Gascoigne has fallen in love. He sighs, and wishes that Heaven had blessed
      him with such a sister&mdash;for <i>sister</i>, read wife. I hope this
      will encourage Rosamond to write again immediately. No; do not tell what I
      have just said about Gascoigne, for&mdash;who knows the perverse ways of
      women?&mdash;perhaps it might prevent her from writing to me at all. You
      may tell her, in general, that it is my opinion ladies always write better
      and do every thing better than men&mdash;except fight, which Heaven forbid
      they should ever do in public or private!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad that Caroline did not marry Mr. Barclay, since she did not like
      him; but by all accounts he is a sensible, worthy man, and I give my
      consent to his marriage with Lady Mary Pembroke, though, from Caroline's
      description, I became half in love with her myself. N.B. I have not been
      in love above six times since I left England, and but once any thing to
      signify. How does the Marchioness of Twickenham go on?

      LETTER FROM ALFRED TO CAROLINE.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR CAROLINE,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to surprise you&mdash;I know it is the most imprudent thing a
      story-teller can do to give notice or promise of a surprise; but you see,
      I have such confidence at this moment in my fact, that I hazard this
      imprudence&mdash;Whom do you think I have seen? Guess&mdash;guess all
      round the breakfast-table&mdash;father, mother, Caroline, Rosamond&mdash;I
      defy you all&mdash;ay, Rosamond, even you, with all your capacity for
      romance; the romance of real life is beyond all other romances&mdash;its
      coincidences beyond the combinations of the most inventive fancy&mdash;even
      of yours, Rosamond&mdash;Granted&mdash;go on&mdash;Patience, ladies, if
      you please, and don't turn over the page, or glance to the end of my
      letter to satisfy your curiosity, but read fairly on, says my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remember, I hope, the Irishman, O'Brien, to whom Erasmus was so good,
      and whom Mr. Gresham, kind as he always is, took for his porter: when Mr.
      Gresham set off last week for Amsterdam, he gave this fellow leave to go
      home to his wife, who lives at Greenwich. This morning, the wife came to
      see my honour to speak to me, and when she did see me she could not speak,
      she was crying so bitterly; she was in the greatest distress about her
      husband: he had, she said, in going to see her, been seized by a
      press-gang, and put on board a tender now on the Thames. Moved by the poor
      Irishwoman's agony of grief, and helpless state, I went to Greenwich,
      where the tender was lying, to speak to the captain, to try to obtain
      O'Brien's release. But upon my arrival there, I found that the woman had
      been mistaken in every point of her story. In short, her husband was not
      on board the tender, had never been pressed, and had only stayed away from
      home the preceding night, in consequence of having met with the captain's
      servant, one of his countrymen, from the county of Leitrim dear, who had
      taken him home to treat him, and had kept him all night to sing 'St.
      Patrick's day in the morning,' and to drink a good journey, and a quick
      passage, across the salt water to his master, which he could not refuse.
      Whilst I was looking at my watch, and regretting my lost morning, a
      gentleman, whose servant had really been pressed, came up to speak to the
      captain, who was standing beside me. The gentleman had something striking
      and noble in his whole appearance; but his address and accent, which were
      those of a foreigner, did not suit the fancy of my English captain, who,
      putting on the surly air, with which he thought it for his honour and for
      the honour of his country to receive a Frenchman, as he took this
      gentleman to be, replied in the least satisfactory manner possible, and in
      the short language of some seamen, 'Your footman's an Englishman, sir; has
      been pressed for an able-bodied seaman, which I trust he'll prove; he's
      aboard the tender, and there he will remain.' The foreigner, who,
      notwithstanding the politeness of his address, seemed to have a high
      spirit, and to be fully sensible of what was due from others to him as
      well as from him to them, replied with temper and firmness. The captain,
      without giving any reasons, or attending to what was said, reiterated, 'I
      am under orders, sir; I am acting according to my orders&mdash;I can do
      neither more nor less. The law is as I tell you, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The foreigner bowed submission to the law, but expressed his surprise
      that such should be law in a land of liberty. With admiration he had
      heard, that, by the English law and British constitution, the property and
      personal liberty of the lowest, the meanest subject, could not be injured
      or oppressed by the highest nobleman in the realm, by the most powerful
      minister, even by the king himself. He had always been assured that the
      king could not put his hand into the purse of the subject, or take from
      him to the value of a single penny; that the sovereign could not deprive
      the meanest of the people unheard, untried, uncondemned, of a single hour
      of his liberty, or touch a hair of his head; he had always, on the
      continent, heard it the boast of Englishmen, that when even a slave
      touched English ground he became free: 'Yet now, to my astonishment,'
      pursued the foreigner, 'what do I see?&mdash;a freeborn British subject
      returning to his native land, after an absence of some years, unoffending
      against any law, innocent, unsuspected of all crime, a faithful domestic,
      an excellent man, prevented from returning to his family and his home, put
      on board a king's ship, unused to hard labour, condemned to work like a
      galley slave, doomed to banishment, perhaps to death!&mdash;Good Heavens!
      In all this where is your English liberty? Where is English justice, and
      the spirit of your English law?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And who the devil are you, sir?' cried the captain, 'who seem to know so
      much and so little of English law?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'My name, if that be of any consequence, is Count Albert Altenberg.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, Caroline, you are surprised.&mdash;'No,' says Rosamond; 'I guessed
      it was he, from the first moment I heard he was a foreigner, and had a
      noble air.''
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Altenberg,' repeated the captain; 'that's not a French name:&mdash;Why,
      you are not a Frenchman!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No, sir&mdash;a German.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ah ha!' cried the captain, suddenly changing his tone, 'I thought you
      were not a Frenchman, or you could not talk so well of English law, and
      feel so much for English liberty; and now, since that's the case, I'll own
      to you frankly, that in the main I'm much of your mind&mdash;and for my
      own particular share, I'd as lieve the Admiralty had sent me to hell as
      have ordered me to press on the Thames. But my business is to obey orders&mdash;which
      I will do, by the blessing of God&mdash;so good morning to you. As to law,
      and justice, and all that, talk to him,' said the captain, pointing with
      his thumb over his left shoulder to me as he walked off hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Poor fellow!' said I; 'this is the hardest part of a British captain's
      duty, and so he feels it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Duty!' exclaimed the count&mdash;'Duty! pardon me for repeating your
      word&mdash;but can it be his duty? I hope I did not pass proper bounds in
      speaking to him; but now he is gone, I may say to you, sir&mdash;to you,
      who, if I may presume to judge from your countenance, sympathize in my
      feelings&mdash;this is a fitter employment for an African slave-merchant
      than for a British officer. The whole scene which I have just beheld there
      on the river, on the banks, the violence, the struggles I have witnessed
      there, the screams of the women and children,&mdash;it is not only
      horrible, but in England incredible! Is it not like what we have heard of
      on the coast of Africa with detestation&mdash;what your humanity has there
      forbidden&mdash;abolished? And is it possible that the cries of those
      negroes across the Atlantic can so affect your philanthropists'
      imaginations, whilst you are deaf or unmoved by these cries of your
      countrymen, close to your metropolis, at your very gates? I think I hear
      them still,' said the count, with a look of horror. 'Such a scene I never
      before beheld! I have seen it&mdash;and yet I cannot believe that I have
      seen it in England.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I acknowledged that the sight was terrible; I could not be surprised that
      the operation of pressing men for the sea service should strike a
      foreigner as inconsistent with the notion of English justice and liberty,
      and I admired the energy and strength of feeling which the count showed;
      but I defended the measure as well as I could, on the plea of necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Necessity!' said the count: 'Pardon me if I remind you that necessity is
      the tyrant's plea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mended my plea, and changed necessity into utility&mdash;general
      utility. It was essential to England's defence&mdash;to her existence&mdash;she
      could not exist without her navy, and her navy could not be maintained
      without a press-gang&mdash;as I was assured by those who were skilled in
      naval affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The count smiled at my evident consciousness of the weakness of my
      concluding corollary, and observed that, by my own statement, the whole
      argument depended on the assertions of those who maintained that a navy
      could not exist without a press-gang. He urged this no further, and I was
      glad of it; his horses and mine were at this moment brought up, and we
      both rode together to town.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that Rosamond, at this instant, is gasping with impatience to hear
      whether in the course of this ride I spoke of M. de Tourville&mdash;and
      the shipwreck. I did&mdash;but not of Euphrosyne: upon that subject I
      could not well touch. He had heard of the shipwreck, and of the
      hospitality with which the sufferers had been treated by an English
      gentleman, and he was surprised and pleased, when I told him that I was
      the son of that gentleman. Of M. de Tourville, the count, I fancy, thinks
      much the same as you do. He spoke of him as an intriguing diplomatist, of
      quick talents, but of a mind incapable of any thing great or generous. The
      count went on from speaking of M. de Tourville to some of the celebrated
      public characters abroad, and to the politics and manners of the different
      courts and countries of Europe. For so young a man, he has seen and
      reflected much. He is indeed a very superior person, as he convinced me
      even in this short ride. You know that Dr. Johnson says, 'that you cannot
      stand for five minutes with a great man under a shed, waiting till a
      shower is over, without hearing him say something that another man could
      not say.' But though the count conversed with me so well and so agreeably,
      I could see that his mind was, from time to time, absent and anxious; and
      as we came into town, he again spoke of the press-gang, and of his poor
      servant&mdash;a faithful attached servant, he called him, and I am sure
      the count is a good master, and a man of feeling. He had offered money to
      obtain the man's release in vain. A substitute it was at this time
      difficult to find&mdash;the count was but just arrived in London, had not
      yet presented any of his numerous letters of introduction; he mentioned
      the names of some of the people to whom these were addressed, and he asked
      me whether application to any of them could be of service. But none of his
      letters were to any of the men now in power. Lord Oldborough was the only
      person I knew whose word would be law in this case, and I offered to go
      with him to his lordship. This I ventured, my dear father, because I
      wisely&mdash;yes, wisely, as you shall see, calculated that the
      introduction of a foreigner, fresh from the continent, and from that court
      where Cunningham Falconer is now resident envoy, would be agreeable, and
      might be useful to the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend, Mr. Temple, who is as obliging and as much my friend now he is
      secretary to <i>the</i> great man as he was when he was a scrivening
      nobody in his garret, obtained audience for us directly. I need not detail&mdash;indeed
      I have not time&mdash;graciously received&mdash;count's business done by a
      line&mdash;Temple ordered to write to Admiralty: Lord Oldborough seemed
      obliged to me for introducing the count&mdash;I saw he wished to have some
      private conversation with him&mdash;rose, and took my leave. Lord
      Oldborough paid me for my discretion on the spot by a kind look&mdash;a
      great deal from him&mdash;and following me to the door of the antechamber,
      'Mr. Percy, I cannot regret that you have followed your own independent
      professional course&mdash;I congratulate you upon your success&mdash;I
      have heard of it from many quarters, and always, believe me, with
      pleasure, on your father's account, and on your own.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next day I found on my table when I came from the courts, the count's
      card&mdash;when I returned his visit, Commissioner Falconer was with him
      in close converse&mdash;confirmed by this in opinion that Lord Oldborough
      is sucking information&mdash;I mean, political secrets&mdash;out of the
      count. The commissioner could not, in common decency, help being
      'exceedingly sorry that he and Mrs. Falconer had seen so little of me of
      late,' nor could he well avoid asking me to a concert, to which he invited
      the count, for the ensuing evening. As the count promised to go, so did I,
      on purpose to meet him. Adieu, dearest Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most affectionately yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      "ALFRED PERCY."
    </p>
    <p>
      To give an account of Mrs. Falconer's concert in fashionable style, we
      should inform the public that Dr. Mudge for ever established his fame in "<i>Buds
      of Roses</i>;" and Miss La Grande was astonishing, absolutely astonishing,
      in "<i>Frenar vorrei le lagrime</i>"&mdash;quite in Catalani's best
      manner; but Miss Georgiana Falconer was divine in "<i>O Giove omnipotente</i>,"
      and quite surpassed herself in "<i>Quanto O quanto è amor possente</i>,"
      in which Dr. Mudge was also capital: indeed it would be doing injustice to
      this gentleman's powers not to acknowledge the universality of his genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps our readers may not feel quite satisfied with this general
      eulogium, and may observe, that all this might have been learnt from the
      newspapers of the day. Then we must tell things plainly and simply, but
      this will not sound nearly so grand, and letting the public behind the
      scenes will destroy all the stage effect and illusion. Alfred Percy went
      to Mrs. Falconer's unfashionably early, in hopes that, as Count Altenberg
      dined there, he might have a quarter of an hour's conversation with him
      before the musical party should assemble. In this hope Alfred was
      mistaken. He found in the great drawing-room only Mrs. Falconer and two
      other ladies, whose names he never heard, standing round the fire; the
      unknown ladies were in close and eager converse about Count Altenberg. "He
      is so handsome&mdash;so polite&mdash;so charming!"&mdash;"He is very rich&mdash;has
      immense possessions abroad, has not he?"&mdash;"Certainly, he has a fine
      estate in Yorkshire."&mdash;"But when did he come to England?"&mdash;"How
      long does he stay?"&mdash;"15,000<i>l.</i>, no, 20,000<i>l.</i> per
      annum."&mdash;"Indeed!"&mdash;"Mrs. Falconer, has not Count Altenberg
      20,000<i>l.</i> a year?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer, seemingly uninterested, stood silent, looking through her
      glass at the man who was lighting the argand lamps. "Really, my dear,"
      answered she, "I can't say&mdash;I know nothing of Count Altenberg&mdash;Take
      care! that argand!&mdash;He's quite a stranger to us&mdash;the
      commissioner met him at Lord Oldborough's, and on Lord Oldborough's
      account, of course&mdash;Vigor, we must have more light, Vigor&mdash;wishes
      to pay him attention&mdash;But here's Mr. Percy," continued she, turning
      to Alfred, "can, I dare say, tell you all about these things. I think the
      commissioner mentioned that it was you, Mr. Percy, who introduced the
      Count to Lord Oldborough."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies immediately fixed their surprised and inquiring eyes upon Mr.
      Alfred Percy&mdash;he seemed to grow in an instant several feet in their
      estimation: but he shrunk again when he acknowledged that he had merely
      met Count Altenberg accidentally at Greenwich&mdash;that he knew nothing
      of the count's estate in Yorkshire, or of his foreign possessions, and was
      utterly incompetent to decide whether he had 10,000<i>l.</i> or 20,000<i>l.</i>
      per annum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's very odd!" said one of the ladies. "But this much I know, that he
      is passionately fond of music, for he told me so at dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I am sure he will be charmed to-night with Miss Georgiana," said the
      confidants.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what signifies that," replied the other lady, "if he has not&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Percy," interrupted Mrs. Falconer, "I have never seen you since that
      sad affair of Lady Harriot H&mdash;&mdash; and Lewis Clay;" and putting
      her arm within Alfred's, she walked him away, talking over the affair, and
      throwing in a proper proportion of compliment. As she reached the folding
      doors, at the farthest end of the room, she opened them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a notion the young people are here." She introduced him into the
      music-room. Miss Georgiana Falconer, at the piano-forte, with performers,
      composers, masters, and young ladies, all with music-books round her, sat
      high in consultation, which Alfred's appearance interrupted&mdash;a faint
      struggle to be civil&mdash;an insipid question or two was addressed to
      him. "Fond of music, Mr. Percy? Captain Percy, I think, likes music? You
      expect Captain Percy home soon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely listening to his answers, the young ladies soon resumed their own
      conversation, forgot his existence, and went on eagerly with their own
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they turned over their music-books, Alfred, for some minutes, heard
      only the names of La Tour, Winter, Von Esch, Lanza, Portogallo,
      Mortellari, Guglielmi, Sacchini, Sarti, Paisiello, pronounced by male and
      female voices in various tones of ecstasy and of execration. Then there
      was an eager search for certain favourite duets, trios, and sets of <i>cavatinas</i>.
      Next he heard, in rapid succession, the names of Tenducci, Pachierotti,
      Marchesi, Viganoni, Braham, Gabrielli, Mara, Banti, Grassini, Billington,
      Catalani. Imagine our young barrister's sense of his profound ignorance,
      whilst he heard the merits of all dead and living composers, singers, and
      masters, decided upon by the Miss Falconers. By degrees he began to see a
      little through the palpable obscure, by which he had at first felt himself
      surrounded: he discerned that he was in a committee of the particular
      friends of the Miss Falconers, who were settling what they should sing and
      play. All, of course, were flattering the Miss Falconers, and abusing
      their absent friends, those especially who were expected to bear a part in
      this concert; for instance&mdash;"Those two eternal Miss Byngs, with
      voices, like cracked bells, and with their old-fashioned music, Handel,
      Corelli, and Pergolese, horrid!&mdash;And odious little Miss Crotch, who
      has science but no taste, execution but no expression!" Here they talked a
      vast deal about expression. Alfred did not understand them, and doubted
      whether they understood themselves. "Then her voice! how people can call
      it fine!&mdash;powerful, if you will&mdash;but overpowering! For my part,
      I can't stand it, can you?&mdash;Every body knows an artificial shake,
      when good, is far superior to a natural shake. As to the Miss Barhams, the
      eldest has no more ear than the table, and the youngest such a thread of a
      voice!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, mamma," interrupted Miss Georgiana Falconer, "are the Miss La
      Grandes to be here to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, my dear&mdash;you know I could not avoid asking the Miss La
      Grandes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, positively," cried Miss Georgiana, her whole face changing, and
      ill-humour swelling in every feature, "then, positively, ma'am, I can't
      and won't sing a note!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my dear love," said Mrs. Falconer, "surely you don't pretend to be
      afraid of the Miss La Grandes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" cried one of the chorus of flatterers&mdash;"You! to whom the La
      Grandes are no more to be compared&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not but that they certainly sing finely, I am told," said Mrs. Falconer;
      "yet I can't say I like their style of singing&mdash;and knowledge of
      music, you know, they don't pretend to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that's true," said Miss Georgiana; "but still, somehow, I can never
      bring out my voice before those girls. If I have any voice at all, it is
      in the lower part, and Miss La Grande always chooses the lower part&mdash;besides,
      ma'am, you know she regularly takes '<i>O Giove omnipotente</i>' from me.
      But I should not mind <i>that</i> even, if she would not attempt poor '<i>Quanto
      O quanto è amor possente</i>'&mdash;there's no standing that! Now, really,
      to hear that so spoiled by Miss La Grande&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! my dear," said Mrs. Falconer, just as Mrs. La Grande appeared&mdash;"Oh!
      my good Mrs. La Grande, how kind is this of you to come to me with your
      poor head! And Miss La Grande and Miss Eliza! We are so much obliged to
      you, for you know that we could not have done without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Miss La Grandes were soon followed by the Miss Barhams and Miss
      Crotch, and they were all "<i>so good, and so kind, and such dear
      creatures</i>." But after the first forced compliments, silence and
      reserve spread among the young ladies of the Miss Falconers' party. It was
      evident that the fair professors were mutually afraid and envious of each
      other, and there was little prospect of harmony of temper. At length the
      gentlemen arrived. Count Altenberg appeared, and came up to pay his
      compliments to the Miss Falconers: as he had not been behind the scenes,
      all was charming illusion to his eyes. No one could appear more
      good-humoured, agreeable, and amiable than Miss Georgiana; she was in
      delightful spirits, well dressed, and admirably supported by her mother.
      The concert began. But who can describe the anxiety of the rival mothers,
      each in agonies to have their daughters brought forward and exhibited to
      the best advantage! Some grew pale, some red&mdash;all, according to their
      different powers of self-command and address, endeavoured to conceal their
      feelings. Mrs. Falconer now shone superior in ease inimitable. She
      appeared absolutely unconcerned for her own daughter, quite intent upon
      bringing into notice the talents of the Miss Barhams, Miss Crotch, the
      Miss La Grandes, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      These young ladies in their turn knew and practised the various arts by
      which at a musical party the unfortunate mistress of the house may be
      tormented. Some, who were sensible that the company were anxious for their
      performance, chose to be "<i>quite out of voice</i>," till they had been
      pressed and flattered into acquiescence; one sweet bashful creature must
      absolutely be forced to the instrument, as a new speaker of the House of
      Commons was formerly dragged to the chair. Then the instrument was not
      what one young lady was <i>used to</i>; the lights were so placed that
      another who was near-sighted could not see a note&mdash;another could not
      endure such a glare. One could not sing unless the windows were all open&mdash;another
      could not play unless they were all shut. With perfect complaisance Mrs.
      Falconer ordered the windows to be opened and shut, and again shut and
      opened; with admirable patience she was, or seemed to be, the martyr to
      the caprices of the fair musicians. While all the time she so manoeuvred
      as to divide, and govern, and finally to have every thing arranged as she
      pleased. None but a perfectly cool stander-by, and one previously
      acquainted with Mrs. Falconer's character, could have seen all that Alfred
      saw. Perhaps the interest he began to take about Count Altenberg, who was
      the grand object of all her operations, increased his penetration. While
      the count was engaged in earnest political conversation in one of the
      inner rooms with the commissioner, Mrs. Falconer besought the Miss La
      Grandes to favour the company. It was impossible for them to resist her
      polite entreaties. Next she called upon Miss Crotch, and the Miss Barhams;
      and she contrived that they should sing and play, and play and sing, till
      they had exhausted the admiration and complaisance of the auditors. Then
      she relieved attention with some slight things from Miss Arabella
      Falconer, such as could excite no <i>sensation</i> or envy. Presently,
      after walking about the room, carelessly joining different conversation
      parties, and saying something obliging to each, she approached the count
      and the commissioner. Finding that the commissioner had finished all he
      had to say, she began to reproach him for keeping the count so long from
      the ladies, and leading him, as she spoke, to the piano-forte, she
      declared that he had missed such charming things. She <i>could</i> not ask
      Miss Crotch to play any more till she had rested&mdash;"Georgiana! for
      want of something better, do try what you can give us&mdash;She will
      appear to great disadvantage, of course&mdash;My dear, I think we have not
      had <i>O Giove omnipotente</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not equal to that, ma'am," said Georgiana, drawing back: "you should
      call upon Miss La Grande."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, my love; but Miss La Grande has been so very obliging, I could not
      ask&mdash;Try it, my love&mdash;I am not surprised you should be diffident
      after what we have heard; but the count, I am sure, will make allowances."
    </p>
    <p>
      With amiable and becoming diffidence Miss Georgiana was compelled to
      comply&mdash;the count was surprised and charmed by her voice: then she
      was prevailed upon to try "<i>Quanta O quanto è amor possente</i>"&mdash;the
      count, who was enthusiastically fond of music, seemed quite enchanted; and
      Mrs. Falconer took care that he should have this impression left full and
      strong upon his mind&mdash;supper was announced. The count was placed at
      the table between Mrs. Falconer and Lady Trant&mdash;but just as they were
      sitting down, Mrs. Falconer called to Georgiana, who was going, much
      against her will, to another table, "Take my place, my dear Georgiana, for
      you know I never eat supper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgiana's countenance, which had been black as night, became all radiant
      instantly. She took her mamma's place beside the count. Mrs. Falconer
      walked about all supper-time smiling, and saying obliging things with
      self-satisfied grace. She had reason indeed to be satisfied with the
      success of this night's operations. Never once did she appear to look
      towards the count, or her daughter; but assuredly she saw that things were
      going on as she wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time Alfred Percy was as heartily tired by the exhibitions of
      this evening as were many fashionable young men who had been loud in their
      praises of the performers. Perhaps Alfred was not however a perfectly fair
      judge, as he was disappointed in his own manoeuvres, not having been able
      to obtain two minutes' conversation with the count during the whole
      evening. In a letter to Rosamond, the next day, he said that Mrs.
      Falconer's concert had been very dull, and he observed that "People can
      see more of one another in a single day in the country than they can in a
      year in town." He was further very eloquent "on the folly of meeting in
      crowds to say commonplace nothings to people you do not care for, and to
      see only the outsides of those with whom you desire to converse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as I was writing this sentence," continues Alfred, "Count Altenberg
      called&mdash;how fortunate!&mdash;how obliging of him to come so early,
      before I went to the courts. He has put me into good humour again with the
      whole world&mdash;even with the Miss Falconers. He came to take leave of
      me&mdash;he is going down to the country&mdash;with whom do you think?&mdash;With
      Lord Oldborough, during the recess. Did I not tell you that Lord
      Oldborough would like him&mdash;that is, would find that he has
      information, and can be useful? I hope you will all see the count; indeed
      I am sure you will. He politely spoke of paying his respects to my father,
      by whom the shipwrecked foreigners had been so hospitably succoured in
      their distress. I told him that our family no longer lived in the same
      place; that we had been obliged to retire to a small estate, in a distant
      part of the county. I did not trouble him with the history of our family
      misfortunes; nor did I even mention how the shipwreck, and the
      carelessness of the Dutch sailors, had occasioned the fire at Percy Hall&mdash;though
      I was tempted to tell him this when I was speaking of M. de Tourville.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forgot to tell my father, that the morning when I went with the count
      to Lord Oldborough's, among a heap of books of heraldry, with which his
      table was covered, I spied an old book of my father's on the <i>arte</i>
      of deciphering, which he had lent Commissioner Falconer years ago. Lord
      Oldborough, whose eye is quick as a hawk's, saw my eye turn towards it,
      and he asked me if I knew any thing of that book, or of the art of
      deciphering? Nothing of the art, but something of the book, which I
      recollected to be my father's. His lordship put it into my hands, and I
      showed some pencil notes of my father's writing. Lord Oldborough seemed
      surprised, and said he did not know this had been among the number of your
      studies. I told him that you had once been much intent upon Wilkins and
      Leibnitz's scheme of a universal language, and that I believed this had
      led you to the art of deciphering. He repeated the words 'Universal
      language&mdash;Ha!&mdash;then I suppose it was from Mr. Percy that
      Commissioner Falconer learnt all he knew on this subject?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I believe so, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ha!' He seemed lost for a moment in thought, and then added, 'I wish I
      had known this sooner&mdash;Ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "What these <i>Haes</i> meant, I was unable to decipher; but I am sure
      they related to some matter very interesting to him. He explained himself
      no farther, but immediately turned away from me to the count, and began to
      talk of the affairs of his court, and of M. de Tourville, of whom he seems
      to have some knowledge, I suppose through the means of his envoy,
      Cunningham Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand that a prodigious party is invited to Falconer-court. The
      count asked me if I was to be one of them, and seemed to wish it&mdash;I
      like him much. They are to have balls, and plays, and great doings. If I
      have time, I will write <i>to-morrow</i>, and tell you who goes, and give
      you a sketch of their characters. Mrs. Falconer cannot well avoid asking
      you to some of her entertainments, and it will be pleasant to you to know
      who's who beforehand."

      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding all the patronage of fashion, which the Miss Falconers had
      for some time enjoyed, notwithstanding all their own accomplishments, and
      their mother's address and knowledge of the world, the grand object had
      not been obtained&mdash;for they were not married. Though every where
      seen, and every where admired, no proposals had yet been made adequate to
      their expectations. In vain had one young nobleman after another, heir
      apparent after heir apparent, been invited, cherished, and flattered by
      Mrs. Falconer, had been constantly at her balls and concerts, had stood
      beside the harp and the piano-forte, had danced or flirted with the Miss
      Falconers, had been hung out at all public places as a pendant to one or
      other of the sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother, seeing project after project fail for the establishment of her
      daughters, forced to bear and to conceal these disappointments, still
      continued to form new schemes with indefatigable perseverance. Yet every
      season the difficulty increased; and Mrs. Falconer, in the midst of the
      life of pleasure which she seemed to lead, was a prey to perpetual
      anxiety. She knew that if any thing should happen to the commissioner,
      whose health was declining; if he should lose Lord Oldborough's favour,
      which seemed not impossible; if Lord Oldborough should not be able to
      maintain himself in power, or if he should die; she and her daughters
      would lose every thing. From a small estate, overwhelmed with debt, there
      would be no fortune for her daughters; they would be left utterly
      destitute, and absolutely unable to do any thing for themselves&mdash;unlikely
      to suit plain country gentlemen, after the high style of company in which
      they had lived, and still more incapable than she would be of bearing a
      reverse of fortune. The young ladies, confident of their charms,
      unaccustomed to reflect, and full of the present, thought little of these
      probabilities of future evil, though they were quite as impatient to be
      married as their mother could wish. Indeed, this impatience becoming
      visible, she was rather anxious to suppress it, because it counteracted
      her views. Mrs. Falconer had still two schemes for their establishment.
      Sir Robert Percy had luckily lost his wife within the last twelvemonth,
      had no children, and had been heard to declare that he would marry again
      as soon as he decently could, because, if he were to die without heirs,
      the Percy estate might revert to the relations, whom he detested. Mrs.
      Falconer had persuaded the commissioner to cultivate Sir Robert Percy's
      acquaintance; had this winter watched for the time when law business
      called him to town; had prevailed upon him to go to her house, instead of
      staying, as he usually did, at an hotel, or spending his day at his
      solicitor's chambers. She had in short made things so agreeable to him,
      and he seemed so well pleased with her, she had hopes he would in time be
      brought to propose for her daughter Arabella. To conciliate Sir Robert
      Percy, it was necessary to avoid all connexion with <i>the other Percys</i>;
      and it was for this reason that the commissioner had of late avoided
      Alfred and Erasmus. Mrs. Falconer's schemes for Georgiana, her beautiful
      daughter, were far more brilliant. Several great establishments she had in
      view. The appearance of Count Altenberg put many old visions to flight&mdash;her
      whole fancy fixed upon him. If she could marry her Georgiana to Count
      Altenberg!&mdash;There would be a match high as her most exalted ambition
      could desire; and this project did not seem impossible. The count had been
      heard to say that he thought Miss Georgiana Falconer the handsomest woman
      he had seen since he had been in London. He had admired her dancing, and
      had listened with enthusiastic attention to her music, and to her charming
      voice; the young lady herself was confident that he was, would be, or
      ought to be, her slave. The count was going into the country for some
      weeks with Lord Oldborough. Mrs. Falconer, though she had not seen
      Falconer-court for fifteen years, decided to go there immediately. Then
      she should have the count fairly away from all the designing mothers and
      rival daughters of her acquaintance, and besides&mdash;she might, by this
      seasonable visit to the country, secure Sir Robert Percy for her daughter
      Arabella. The commissioner rejoiced in his lady's determination, because
      he knew that it would afford him an opportunity of obliging Lord
      Oldborough. His lordship had always been averse from the trouble of
      entertaining company. He disliked it still more since the death of Lady
      Oldborough; but he knew that it was necessary to keep up his interest and
      his popularity in the country, and he would, therefore, be obliged by Mrs.
      Falconer's giving dinners and entertainments for him. This game had
      succeeded, when it had been played&mdash;at the time of the Marchioness of
      Twickenham's marriage. Mr. Falconer was particularly anxious now to please
      Lord Oldborough, for he was fully aware that he had lost ground with his
      patron, and that his sons had all in different ways given his lordship
      cause of dissatisfaction. With Buckhurst Falconer Lord Oldborough was
      displeased for being the companion and encourager of his nephew, Colonel
      Hauton, in extravagance and gaming. In paying his court to the nephew,
      Buckhurst lost the uncle. Lord Oldborough had hoped that a man of
      literature and talents, as Buckhurst had been represented to him, would
      have drawn his nephew from the turf to the senate, and would have raised
      in Colonel Hauton's mind some noble ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A clergyman! sir," said Lord Oldborough to Commissioner Falconer, with a
      look of austere indignation.&mdash;"What could induce such a man as Mr.
      Buckhurst Falconer to become a clergyman?" The commissioner, affecting to
      sympathize in this indignation, declared that he was so angry with his son
      that he would not see him. All the time, however, he comforted himself
      with the hope that his son would, in a few months, be in possession of the
      long-expected living of Chipping-Friars, as the old incumbent was now
      speechless. Lord Oldborough had never, after this disowning of Buckhurst,
      mentioned his name to the father, and the commissioner thought this
      management had succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of John Falconer, too, there had been complaints. Officers returned from
      abroad had spoken of his stupidity, his neglect of duty, and, above all,
      of his boasting that, let him do what he pleased, he was sure of Lord
      Oldborough's favour&mdash;certain of being a major in one year, a
      lieutenant-colonel in two. At first his boasts had been laughed at by his
      brother officers, but when, at the year's end, he actually was made a
      major, their surprise and discontent were great. Lord Oldborough was
      blamed for patronizing such a fellow. All this, in course of time, came to
      his lordship's knowledge. He heard these complaints in silence. It was not
      his habit suddenly to express his displeasure. He heard, and saw, without
      speaking or acting, till facts and proofs had accumulated in his mind. He
      seemed to pass over many things unobserved, but they were all registered
      in his memory, and he would judge and decide at last in an instant, and
      irrevocably. Of this Commissioner Falconer, a cunning man, who watched
      parts of a character narrowly, but could not take in the whole, was not
      aware. He often blessed his good fortune for having escaped Lord
      Oldborough's displeasure or detection, upon occasions when his lordship
      had marked all that the commissioner imagined he had overlooked; his
      lordship was often most awake to what was passing, and most displeased,
      when he appeared most absent or unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, many mistakes, and much ignorance, had frequently appeared
      in his envoy Cunningham Falconer's despatches; but except when, in the
      first moment of surprise at the difference between the ineptitude of the
      envoy, and the talents of the author of the pamphlet, his lordship had
      exclaimed, "<i>A slovenly despatch</i>," these mistakes, and this
      ignorance, had passed without animadversion. Some symptoms of duplicity,
      some evasion of the minister's questions, had likewise appeared, and the
      commissioner had trembled lest the suspicions of his patron should be
      awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg, without design to injure Cunningham, had accidentally
      mentioned in the presence of the commissioner and of Lord Oldborough
      something of a transaction which was to be kept a profound secret from the
      minister, a private intrigue which Cunningham had been carrying on to get
      himself appointed envoy to the court of Denmark, by the interest of the
      opposite party, in case of a change of ministry. At the moment when this
      was alluded to by Count Altenberg, the commissioner was so dreadfully
      alarmed that he perspired at every pore; but perceiving that Lord
      Oldborough expressed no surprise, asked no explanation, never looked
      towards him with suspicion, nor even raised his eyes, Mr. Falconer
      flattered himself that his lordship was so completely engrossed in the
      operation of replacing a loose glass in his spectacles, that he had not
      heard or noticed one word the count had said. In this hope the
      commissioner was confirmed by Lord Oldborough's speaking an instant
      afterwards precisely in his usual tone, and pursuing his previous subject
      of conversation, without any apparent interruption in the train of his
      ideas. Yet, notwithstanding that the commissioner fancied that he and his
      son had escaped, and were secure in each particular instance, he had a
      general feeling that Lord Oldborough was more reserved towards him; and he
      was haunted by a constant fear of losing, not his patron's esteem or
      confidence, but his favour. Against this danger he constantly guarded. To
      flatter, to keep Lord Oldborough in good humour, to make himself agreeable
      and necessary by continual petty submissions and services, was the sum of
      his policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with this view that he determined to go into the country; and with
      this view he had consented to various expenses, which were necessary, as
      Mrs. Falconer declared, to make it practicable for her and her daughters
      to accompany him. Orders were sent to have a theatre at Falconer-court,
      which had been long disused, fitted up in the most elegant manner. The
      Miss Falconers had been in the habit of acting at Sir Thomas and Lady
      Flowerton's private theatre at Richmond, and they were accomplished
      actresses. Count Altenberg had declared that he was particularly fond of
      theatrical amusements. That hint was sufficient. Besides, what a sensation
      the opening of a theatre at Falconer-court would create in the country!
      Mrs. Falconer observed that the only possible way to make the country
      supportable was to have a large party of town friends in your house&mdash;and
      this was the more necessary for her, as she was almost a stranger in her
      own county.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred kept his promise, and sent Rosamond a list of the persons of whom
      the party was to consist. Opposite to several names he wrote&mdash;commonplace
      young&mdash;or, commonplace old ladies:&mdash;of the latter number were
      Lady Trant and Lady Kew: of the former were the Miss G&mdash;&mdash;s, and
      others not worth mentioning. Then came the two Lady Arlingtons, nieces of
      the Duke of Greenwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Lady Arlingtons," continues Alfred, "are glad to get to Mrs.
      Falconer, and Mrs. Falconer is glad to have them, because they are related
      to my lord duke. I have met them at Mrs. Falconer's, at Lady Angelica
      Headingham's, and often at Lady Jane Granville's. The style and tone of
      the Lady Anne is languishing&mdash;of Lady Frances, lively: both seem mere
      spoilt selfish ladies of quality. Lady Anne's selfishness is of the cold,
      chronic, inveterate nature; Lady Frances' of the hot, acute, and
      tormenting species. She 'loves everything by fits, and nothing long.'
      Every body is <i>an angel</i> and <i>a dear creature</i>, while they
      minister to her fancies&mdash;and no longer. About these fancies she is
      restless and impatient to a degree which makes her sister look sick and
      scornful beyond description. Lady Anne neither fancies nor loves any thing
      or any body. She seems to have no object upon earth but to drink
      barley-water, and save herself from all manner of trouble or exertion,
      bodily or mental. So much for the Lady Arlingtons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buckhurst Falconer cannot be of this party&mdash;Colonel Hauton has him
      at his regiment. But Buckhurst's two friends, the Clays, are earnestly
      pressed into the service. Notwithstanding the fine sanctified speech Mrs.
      Falconer made me, about <i>that sad affair of Lewis Clay with Lady Harriot
      H&mdash;&mdash;</i>, she invites him; and I have a notion, if Count
      Altenberg had not appeared, that she would have liked to have had him, <i>or</i>
      his brother, for her son-in-law. That you may judge how much my mother
      would like them for her sons-in-law, I will take the trouble to draw you
      portraits of both gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>French</i> Clay and <i>English</i> Clay, as they have been named, are
      brothers, both men of large fortune, which their father acquired
      respectably by commerce, and which they are spending in all kinds of
      extravagance and profligacy, not from inclination, but merely to purchase
      admission into fine company. French Clay is a travelled coxcomb, who, <i>à
      propos de bottes</i>, begins with, 'When I was abroad with the Princess
      Orbitella&mdash;' But I am afraid I cannot speak of this man with
      impartiality, for I cannot bear to see an Englishman apeing a Frenchman.
      The imitation is always so awkward, so ridiculous, so contemptible. French
      Clay talks of <i>tact</i>, but without possessing any; he delights in what
      he calls <i>persiflage</i>, but in his <i>persiflage</i>, instead of the
      wit and elegance of Parisian raillery, there appears only the vulgar love
      and habit of derision. He is continually railing at our English want of <i>savoir
      vivre</i>, yet is himself an example of the ill-breeding which he
      reprobates. His manners have neither the cordiality of an Englishman nor
      the polish of a foreigner. To improve us in <i>l'esprit de société</i>, he
      would introduce the whole system of French gallantry&mdash;the vice
      without the refinement. I heard him acknowledge it to be 'his principle'
      to intrigue with every <i>married</i> woman who would listen to him,
      provided she has any one of his four requisites, wit, fashion, beauty, or
      a good table. He says his late suit in Doctors'-commons cost him nothing;
      for 10,000<i>l.</i> are nothing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Public virtue, as well as private, he thinks it a fine air to disdain,
      and patriotism and love of our country, he calls prejudices of which a
      philosopher ought to divest himself. Some charitable people say that he is
      not so unfeeling as he seems to be, and that above half his vices arise
      from affectation, and from a mistaken ambition to be what he thinks
      perfectly French.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His brother, English Clay, is a cold, reserved, proud, dull-looking man,
      whom art, in despite of nature, strove, and strove in vain, to quicken
      into a 'gay deceiver.' He is a grave man of pleasure&mdash;his first care
      being to provide for his exclusively personal gratifications. His dinner
      is a serious, solemn business, whether it be at his own table or at a
      tavern, which last he prefers&mdash;he orders it so that his repast shall
      be the very best of its kind that money can procure. His next care is,
      that he be not cheated in what he is to pay. Not that he values money, but
      he cannot bear to be <i>taken in</i>. Then his dress, his horses his whole
      appointment and establishment, are complete, and accurately in the fashion
      of the day&mdash;no expense spared. All that belongs to Mr. Clay, of
      Clay-hall, is the best of its kind, or, at least, <i>had from the best
      hand</i> in England. Every thing about him is English; but I don't know
      whether this arises from love of his country or contempt of his brother.
      English Clay is not ostentatious of that which is his own, but he is
      disdainful of all that belongs to another. The slightest deficiency in the
      <i>appointments</i> of his companions he sees, and marks by a wink to some
      bystander, or with a dry joke laughs the wretch to scorn. In company he
      delights to sit by silent and snug, sneering inwardly at those who are
      entertaining the company, and <i>committing</i> themselves. He never
      entertains, and is seldom entertained. His joys are neither convivial nor
      intellectual; he is gregarious, but not companionable; a hard drinker, but
      not social. Wine sometimes makes him noisy, but never makes him gay; and,
      whatever be his excesses, he commits them seemingly without temptation
      from taste or passion. He keeps a furiously expensive mistress, whom he
      curses, and who curses him, as Buckhurst informs me, ten times a day; yet
      he prides himself on being free and unmarried! Scorning and dreading women
      in general, he swears he would not marry Venus herself unless she had
      100,000<i>l.</i> in each pocket; and now that no mortal Venus wears
      pockets, he thanks Heaven he is safe. Buckhurst, I remember, assured me
      that beneath this crust of pride there is some good-nature. Deep hid under
      a large mass of selfishness there may be some glimmerings of affection. He
      shows symptoms of feeling for his horses, and his mother, and his
      coachman, and his country. I do believe he would fight for old England,
      for it is his country, and he is English Clay. Affection for his coachman,
      did I say?&mdash;He shows admiration, if not affection, for every whip of
      note in town. He is their companion&mdash;no, their pupil, and, as
      Antoninus Pius gratefully prided himself in recording the names of those
      relations and friends from whom he learnt his several virtues, this man
      may boast to after-ages of having learnt from one coachman how to cut a
      fly off his near leader's ear, how to tuck up a duck from another, and the
      <i>true spit</i> from a third&mdash;by-the-bye, it is said, but I don't
      vouch for the truth of the story, that this last accomplishment cost him a
      tooth, which he had had drawn to attain it in perfection. Pure <i>slang</i>
      he could not learn from any one coachman, but from constantly frequenting
      the society of all. I recollect Buckhurst Falconer telling me that he
      dined once with English Clay, in company with a baronet, a viscount, an
      earl, a duke, and the driver of a mail-coach, to whom was given, by
      acclamation, the seat of honour. I am told there is a house, at which
      these gentlemen and noblemen meet regularly every week, where there are
      two dining-rooms divided by glass doors. In one room the real coachmen
      dined, in the other the amateur gentlemen, who, when they are tired of
      their own conversation, throw open the glass doors, that they may be
      entertained and edified by the coachmen's wit and <i>slang</i>; in which
      dialect English Clay's rapid proficiency has, it is said, recommended him
      to the <i>best</i> society, even more than his being the master of the
      best of cooks, and of Clay-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have said so much more than I intended of both these brothers, that I
      have no room for more portraits; indeed, the other gentlemen are zeros.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours affectionately,
    </p>
    <p>
      "ALFRED PERCY."
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the pains which Mrs. Falconer took to engage these Mr.
      Clays to accompany her, she could obtain only a promise that they would
      wait upon her, if possible, some time during the recess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg also, much to Mrs. Falconer's disappointment, was detained
      in town a few days longer than he had foreseen, but he promised to follow
      Lord Oldborough early in the ensuing week. All the rest of the <i>prodigious</i>
      party arrived at Falconer-court, which was within a few miles of Lord
      Oldborough's seat at Clermont-park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after Lord Oldborough's arrival in the country, his lordship was
      seized with a fit of the gout, which fixed in his right hand. Commissioner
      Falconer, when he came in the morning to pay his respects, and to inquire
      after his patron's health, found him in his study, writing a letter with
      his left hand. "My lord, shall not I call Mr. Temple&mdash;or&mdash;could
      I offer my services as secretary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, sir&mdash;no. This letter must be written with my own hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whom can this letter be to, that is of so much consequence? thought the
      commissioner; and glancing his eye at the direction, he saw, as the letter
      was given to a servant, "<i>To L. Percy, Esq.</i>"&mdash;his surprise
      arrested the pinch of snuff which he was just going to take. "What could
      be the business&mdash;the secret&mdash;only a few lines, what could they
      contain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply these words
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I write to you with my left hand, the gout having, within these few
      hours, incapacitated my right. Since this gout keeps me a prisoner, and I
      cannot, as I had intended, go to you, may I beg that you will do me the
      favour to come to me, if it could suit your convenience, to-morrow
      morning, when I shall be alone from twelve till four.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With true esteem,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      "OLDBOROUGH."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the day the commissioner found out, by something Lord
      Oldborough <i>let fall</i>, what his lordship had no intention to conceal,
      that he had requested Mr. Percy to come to Clermont-park the next morning;
      and the commissioner promised himself that he would be in the way to see
      his good cousin Percy, and to satisfy his curiosity. But his manoeuvres
      and windings were, whenever it was necessary, counteracted and cut short
      by the unexpected directness and peremptory plain dealing of his patron.
      In the morning, towards the hour of twelve, the commissioner thought he
      had well begun a conversation that would draw out into length upon a topic
      which he knew must be interesting to his lordship, and he held in his hand
      private letters of great consequence from his son Cunningham; but Lord
      Oldborough, taking the letters, locked them up in his desk, saying,
      "To-night I will read them&mdash;this morning I have set apart for a
      conversation with Mr. Percy, whom I wish to see alone. In the mean time,
      my interest in the borough has been left too much to the care of that
      attorney Sharpe, of whom I have no great opinion. Will you be so good to
      ride over, as you promised me that you would, to the borough, and see what
      is doing there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner endeavoured not to look disconcerted or discomfited, rang
      the bell for his horses, and took his leave, as Lord Oldborough had
      determined that he should, before the arrival of Mr. Percy, who came
      exactly at twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you for this punctuality, Mr. Percy," said Lord Oldborough,
      advancing in his most gracious manner; and no two things could be more
      strikingly different than his gracious and ungracious manner. "I thank you
      for this kind punctuality. No one knows better than I do the difference
      between the visit of a friend and all other visits."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without preface, Lord Oldborough always went directly to the point. "I
      have requested you to come to me, Mr. Percy, because I want from you two
      things, which I cannot have so much to my satisfaction from any other
      person as from you&mdash;assistance and sympathy. But, before I go to my
      own affairs, let me&mdash;and not by way of compliment, but plainly and
      truly&mdash;let me congratulate you, my dear sir, on the success of your
      sons, on the distinction and independence they have already acquired in
      their professions. I know the value of independence&mdash;of that which I
      shall never have," added his lordship, with a forced smile and a deep
      sigh. "But let that be. It was not of that I meant to speak. You pursue
      your course; I, mine. Firmness of purpose I take to be the great
      difference between man and man. I am not one of those who habitually covet
      sympathy. It is a sign of a mind insufficient to its own support, to look
      for sympathy on every trivial occurrence; and on great occasions it has
      not been my good fortune to meet many persons who could sympathize with
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said Mr. Percy, "people must think with you, before they can feel
      with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is extraordinary, Mr. Percy," continued Lord Oldborough, "that,
      knowing how widely you differ from me in political principles, I should
      choose, of all men living, to open my mind to you. But the fact is, that I
      am convinced, however we may differ about the means, the end we both have
      in view is one and the same&mdash;the good and glory of the British
      empire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, I believe it," cried Mr. Percy&mdash;with energy and warmth he
      repeated, "My lord, I believe it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, sir," said Lord Oldborough; "you do me justice. I have
      reason to be satisfied when such men as you do me justice; I have reason
      also to be satisfied that I have not to make the common complaint of those
      who serve princes. From him whom I have served I have not met with any
      ingratitude, with any neglect: on the contrary, I am well assured, that so
      firm is his conviction of my intending the good of his throne and of his
      people, that to preserve me his minister is the first wish of his heart. I
      am confident that without hesitation he would dismiss from his councils
      any who should obstruct my views, or be inimical to my interests."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, my lord, you are happy; if man can be happy at the summit of
      ambition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me. It is a dizzy height at best; but, were it attained, I trust
      my head would be strong enough to bear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Verulam, you know, my lord," said Mr. Percy, smiling, "tells us,
      that people, by looking down precipices, do put their spirits in the act
      of falling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, true," said Lord Oldborough, rather impatient at Mr. Percy's going
      to Lord Verulam and philosophy. "But you have not yet heard the facts. I
      am encompassed with enemies, open and secret. Open enemies I meet and defy&mdash;their
      strength I can calculate and oppose; but the strength of my secret enemies
      I cannot calculate, for that strength depends on their combination, and
      that combination I cannot break till I know of what it consists. I have
      the power and the will to strike, but know not where to aim. In the dark I
      will not strike, lest I injure the innocent or destroy a friend. Light I
      cannot obtain, though I have been in search of it for a considerable time.
      Perhaps by your assistance it may be obtained."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my assistance!" exclaimed Mr. Percy: "ignorant, as I am, of all
      parties, and of all their secret transactions, how, my dear lord, can I
      possibly afford you any assistance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely by your being unconnected with all parties&mdash;a cool
      stander-by, you can judge of the play&mdash;you can assist me with your
      general knowledge of human nature, and with a particular species of
      knowledge, of which I should never have guessed that you were possessed,
      but for an accidental discovery of it made to me the other day by your son
      Alfred&mdash;your knowledge of the art of deciphering."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough then produced the Tourville papers, related how they had
      been put into his hands by Commissioner Falconer, showed him what the
      commissioner and his son had deciphered, pointed out where the remaining
      difficulty occurred, and explained how they were completely at a stand
      from their inability to decipher the word Gassoc, or to decide who or what
      it could mean. All the conjectures of the commissioner, the cassock, and
      the bishop, and the <i>gosshawk</i>, and the heraldic researches, and the
      French misnomers, and the puns upon the coats of arms, and the notes from
      Wilkins on universal language, and an old book on deciphering, which had
      been lent to the commissioner, and the private and public letters which
      Cunningham had written since he went abroad, were all laid before Mr.
      Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to my envoy, Mr. Cunningham Falconer," said Lord Oldborough, as he
      took up the bundle of Cunningham's letters, "I do not choose to interrupt
      the main business before us, by adverting to him or to his character,
      farther than to point out to you this mark," showing a peculiar pencil
      mark, made on certain papers. "This is my note of distrust, observe, and
      this my note for mere circumlocution, or nonsense. And here," continued
      his lordship, "is a list of all those in, or connected with the ministry,
      whom it is possible may be my enemies." The list was the same as that on
      which the commissioner formerly went to work, except that the name of the
      Duke of Greenwich had been struck out, and two others added in his place,
      so that it stood thus: "Dukes of Doncaster and Stratford; Lords Coleman,
      Naresby, Skreene, Twisselton, Waltham, Wrexfield, Chelsea, and Lancaster;
      Sir Thomas Cope, Sir James Skipworth; Secretaries Arnold and Oldfield."
      This list was marked with figures, in different coloured inks, prefixed to
      each name, denoting the degrees of their supposed enmity to Lord
      Oldborough, and these had been calculated from a paper, containing notes
      of the probable causes and motives of their disaffection, drawn up by
      Commissioner Falconer, but corrected, and in many places contradicted, by
      notes in Lord Oldborough's hand-writing. His lordship marked which was <i>his</i>
      calculation of probabilities, and made some observations on the character
      of each, as he read over the list of names rapidly.

    </p>
    <p>
      "And is this the summary of the history of the men with whom your lordship
      is obliged to act and live?" said Mr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is&mdash;I am: but, my dear sir, do not let us fly off at a tangent to
      morality or philosophy; these have nothing to do with the present purpose.
      You have before you all the papers relative to this transaction. Now, will
      you do me the favour, the service, to look them over, and try whether you
      can make out <i>le mot d'énigme</i>? I shall not disturb you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough sat down at a small table by the fire, with a packet of
      letters and memorials beside him, and in a few minutes was completely
      absorbed in these, for he had acquired the power of turning his attention
      suddenly and entirely from one subject to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without reading the mass of Commissioner Falconer's explanations and
      conjectures, or encumbering his understanding with all that Cunningham had
      collected, as if purposely to puzzle the cause, Mr. Percy examined first
      very carefully the original documents&mdash;then Lord Oldborough's notes
      on the views and characters of the suspected persons, and the reasons of
      their several enmities or dissatisfaction. From the scale of
      probabilities, which he found had been with great skill calculated on
      these notes, he selected the principal names, and then tried with these,
      whether he could make out an idea that had struck him the moment he had
      heard of the Gassoc. He recollected the famous word Cabal, in the reign of
      Charles the Second, and he thought it possible that the cabalistical word
      Gassoc might be formed by a similar combination. But <i>Gassoc</i> was no
      English word, was no word of any language. Upon close examination of the
      Tourville papers, he perceived that the commissioner had been right in one
      of his suggestions, that the <i>G</i> had been written instead of a <i>C</i>:
      in some places it had been a <i>c</i> turned into a <i>g</i>, and the
      writer seemed to be in doubt whether the word should be Gassoc or Cassoc.
      Assuming, therefore, that it was <i>Cassock</i>, Mr. Percy found the
      initials of six persons, who stood high in Lord Oldborough's scale of
      probabilities: Chelsea&mdash;Arnold&mdash;Skreene&mdash;Skipworth&mdash;Oldfield&mdash;Coleman;
      and the last k, for which he hunted in vain a considerable time, was
      supplied by Kensington (one of the Duke of Greenwich's titles), whose name
      had been scratched out of the list, since his reconciliation and connexion
      by marriage with Lord Oldborough, but who had certainly at one time been
      of the league of his lordship's enemies. Every circumstance and date in
      the Tourville papers exactly agree with this explanation: the Cassock thus
      composed cleared up all difficulties; and passages, that were before dark
      and mysterious, were rendered by this reading perfectly intelligible. The
      interpretation, when once given, appeared so simple, that Lord Oldborough
      wondered how it was possible that it had not before occurred to his mind.
      His satisfaction was great&mdash;he was at this moment relieved from all
      danger of mistaking friend for foe; he felt that his enemies were in his
      power, and his triumph secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir," cried he, "you do not know, you cannot estimate, the extent
      of the service you have done me: far from wishing to lessen it in your
      eyes, I wish you to know at this moment its full importance. By Lady
      Oldborough's death, and by circumstances with which I need not trouble
      you, I lost the support of her connexions. The Duke of Greenwich, though
      my relation, is a weak man, and a weak man can never be a good friend. I
      was encompassed, undermined, the ground hollow under me&mdash;I knew it,
      but I could not put my finger upon one of the traitors. Now I have them
      all at one blow, and I thank you for it. I have the character, I believe,
      of being what is called proud, but you see that I am not too proud to be
      assisted and obliged by one who will never allow me to oblige or assist
      him or any of his family. But why should this be? Look over the list of
      these men. In some one of these places of trust, give me a person in whom
      I can confide, a friend to me, and to your country. Look over that list,
      now in your hand, and put your finger upon any thing that will suit you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, my lord," said Mr. Percy; "I feel the full value of your
      good opinion, and true gratitude for the warmth of your friendship, but I
      cannot accept of any office under your administration. Our political
      principles differ as much as our private sentiments of honour agree; and
      these sentiments will, I trust, make you approve of what I now say&mdash;and
      do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there are places, there are situations which you might accept, where
      your political opinions and mine could never clash. It is an extraordinary
      thing for a minister to press a gentleman to accept of a place, unless he
      expects more in return than what he gives. But come&mdash;I must have Mr.
      Percy one of us. You have never tried ambition yet," added Lord
      Oldborough, with a smile: "trust me, you will find ambition has its
      pleasures, its proud moments, when a man feels that he has his foot on the
      neck of his enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough stood, as if he felt this pride at the instant. "You do
      not know the charms of ambition, Mr. Percy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be delightful to feel one's foot on the neck of one's enemies,
      but, for my part, I rather prefer having no enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No enemies!" said Lord Oldborough: "every man that has character enough
      to make friends has character enough to make enemies&mdash;and must have
      enemies, if not of his power or place, of his talents and property&mdash;the
      sphere lower, the passion's the same. No enemies!&mdash;What is he, who
      has been at law with you, and has robbed you of your estate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forgot him&mdash;upon my word, I forgot him," said Mr. Percy. "You see,
      my lord, if he robbed me of my estate, he did not rob me of my peace of
      mind. Does your lordship think," said Mr. Percy, smiling, "that any
      ambitious man, deprived of his place, could say as much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I can tell you that from my own experience, you shall know," said
      Lord Oldborough, replying in the same tone; "but, thanks to your
      discovery, there seems to be little chance, at present, of my being
      competent to answer that question. But to business&mdash;we are wasting
      life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Every word or action that did not tend to a political purpose appeared to
      Lord Oldborough to be a waste of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your ultimatum? Can you be one of us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible, my lord. Pardon me if I say, that the nearer the view your
      confidence permits me to take of the workings of your powerful mind, and
      of the pains and penalties of your exalted situation, the more clearly I
      feel that ambition is not for me, that my happiness lies in another line."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough&mdash;I have done&mdash;the subject is at rest between us for
      ever." A cloud, followed instantaneously by a strong radiance of pleasure,
      passed across Lord Oldborough's countenance, while he pronounced, as if
      speaking to himself, the words, "Singular obstinacy! Admirable
      consistency! And I too am consistent, my dear sir," said he, sitting down
      at the table. "Now for business; but I am deprived of my right hand." He
      rang, and desired his secretary, Mr. Temple, to be sent to him. Mr. Percy
      rose to take leave, but Lord Oldborough would not permit him to go. "I can
      have no secrets for you, Mr. Percy&mdash;stay and see the end of the
      Cassock."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple came in; and Lord Oldborough, with that promptitude and
      decision by which he was characterised, dictated a letter to the king,
      laying before his majesty the whole intrigue, as discovered by the
      Tourville papers, adding a list of the members of the <i>Cassock</i>&mdash;concluding
      by begging his majesty's permission to resign, unless the cabal, which had
      rendered his efforts for the good of the country and for his majesty's
      service in some points abortive, should be dismissed from his majesty's
      councils. In another letter to a private friend, who had access to the
      royal ear, Lord Oldborough named the persons, whom, if his majesty should
      do him the favour of consulting him, he should wish to recommend in the
      places of those who might be dismissed. His lordship farther remarked,
      that the marriage which had taken place between his niece and the eldest
      son of the Duke of Greenwich, and the late proofs of his grace's
      friendship, dissipated all fears and resentment arising from his former
      connexion with the Cassock. Lord Oldborough therefore entreated his
      majesty to continue his grace in his ministry. All this was stated in the
      shortest and plainest terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No rounded periods, <i>no phrases</i>, no fine writing, Mr. Temple, upon
      this occasion, if you please; it must be felt that these letters are
      straight from my mind, and that if they are not written by my own hand, it
      is because that hand is disabled. As soon as the gout will let me stir, I
      shall pay my duty to my sovereign in person. These arrangements will be
      completed, I trust, by the meeting of parliament. In the mean time I am
      better here than in London; the blow will be struck, and none will know by
      whom&mdash;not but what I am ready to avow it, if called upon. But&mdash;let
      the coffee-house politicians decide, and the country gentlemen prose upon
      it," said Lord Oldborough, smiling&mdash;"some will say the ministry split
      on India affairs, some on Spanish, some on French affairs. How little
      they, any of them, know what passes or what governs behind the curtain!
      Let them talk&mdash;whilst I act."
    </p>
    <p>
      The joy of this discovery so raised Lord Oldborough's spirits, and dilated
      his heart, that he threw himself open with a freedom and hilarity, and
      with a degree of humour unusual to him, and unknown except to the few in
      his most intimate confidence. The letters finished, Mr. Temple was
      immediately despatched with them to town.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There," said Lord Oldborough, as soon as Mr. Temple had left him,
      "there's a secretary I can depend upon; and there is another obligation I
      owe to your family&mdash;to your son Alfred."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this business of the Tourville papers was off his mind, Lord
      Oldborough, though not much accustomed to turn his attention to the lesser
      details of domestic life, spoke of every individual of the Percy family
      with whom he was acquainted; and, in particular, of Godfrey, to whom he
      was conscious that he had been unjust. Mr. Percy, to relieve him from this
      regret, talked of the pleasure his son had had in his friend Gascoigne's
      late promotion to the lieutenant-colonelcy. Whilst Mr. Percy spoke, Lord
      Oldborough searched among a packet of letters for one which made
      honourable mention of Captain Percy, and put it into the hands of the
      happy father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! these are pleasurable feelings denied to me," said Lord Oldborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause he added, "That nephew of mine, Colonel Hauton, is
      irretrievably profligate, selfish, insignificant. I look to my niece, the
      Marchioness of Twickenham's child, that is to say, if the mother&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Another long pause, during which his lordship rubbed the glasses of his
      spectacles, and looked through them, as if intent that no speck should
      remain; while he did this very slowly, his mind ran rapidly from the idea
      of the Marchioness of Twickenham to John Falconer, and thence to all the
      causes of distrust and discontent which he felt towards all the different
      individuals of the Falconer family. He considered, that now the Tourville
      papers had been completely deciphered, the necessity for engaging the
      secrecy of the commissioner, and of his son Cunningham, would soon cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough's reverie was interrupted by seeing, at this instant, the
      commissioner returning from his ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a word, Mr. Percy, of what has passed between us, to Commissioner
      Falconer&mdash;not a word of the <i>Gassoc</i>. I put you on your guard,
      because you live with those in whom you have entire confidence," said Lord
      Oldborough; "but that is what a public man, a minister, cannot do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason why I should not like to be a minister, thought Mr. Percy.
      "I took it for granted that the commissioner was entirely in your
      lordship's confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you were too good a philosopher to take any thing for granted,
      Mr. Percy. Consider, if you please, that I am in a situation where I must
      have tools, and use them, as long as I can make them serviceable to my
      purposes. Sir, I am not a missionary, but a minister. I must work with
      men, and upon men, such as I find them. I am not a chemist, to analyze and
      purify the gold. I make no objection to that alloy, which I am told is
      necessary, and fits it for being moulded to my purposes. But here comes
      the ductile commissioner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough began to talk to him of the borough, without any mercy for
      his curiosity, and without any attempt to evade the various dexterous
      pushes he made to discover the business which had this morning occupied
      his lordship. Mr. Percy was surprised, in the course of this day, to see
      the manner in which the commissioner, a gentleman well-born, of originally
      independent fortune and station, humbled and abased himself to a patron.
      Mr. Falconer had contracted a certain cringing servility of manner, which
      completely altered his whole appearance, and which quite prevented him
      even from looking like a gentleman. It was his principle never to
      contradict a great man, never to give him any sort of pain; and his idea
      of the deference due to rank, and of the danger of losing favour by giving
      offence, was carried so far, that not only his attitude and language, but
      his whole mind, seemed to be new modified. He had not the free use of his
      faculties. He seemed really so to subdue and submit his powers, that his
      understanding was annihilated. Mr. Percy was astonished at the change in
      his cousin; the commissioner was equally surprised, nay, actually
      terrified, by Mr. Percy's freedom and boldness. "Good Heavens! how can you
      speak in this manner?" said Mr. Falconer, as they were going down stairs
      together, after parting with Lord Oldborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not?&mdash;I have nothing to fear or to hope, nothing to gain or
      to lose. Lord Oldborough can give me nothing that I would accept, but his
      esteem, and that I am sure of never losing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Heigho! if I had your favour with my lord, what I would make of it!
      thought the commissioner, as he stepped into his chariot. Mr. Percy
      mounted his horse, and rode back to his humble home, glad to have done his
      friend Lord Oldborough a service, still more glad that he was not bound to
      the minister by any of the chains of political dependence. Rejoiced to
      quit Tourville papers&mdash;state intrigues&mdash;lists of enemies,&mdash;and
      all the necessity for reserve and <i>management</i>, and all the turmoil
      of ambition.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg arrived at Clermont-park, and as Lord Oldborough was still
      confined by the gout, Commissioner Falconer, to his lady's infinite
      satisfaction, was deputed to show him every thing that was worth seeing in
      this part of the country. Every morning some party was formed by Mrs.
      Falconer, and so happily arranged that her Georgiana and the count were
      necessarily thrown together. The count rode extremely well; Miss Falconers
      had been taught to ride in a celebrated riding-house, and were delighted
      to display their equestrian graces. When they were not disposed to ride,
      the count had a phaeton; and Mrs. Falconer a barouche; and either in the
      phaeton, or the barouche seat, Miss Georgiana Falconer was seated with the
      count, who, as she discovered, drove uncommonly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count had expressed a desire to see the place where M. de Tourville
      had been shipwrecked, and he really wished to be introduced to the Percy
      family, of whom, from the specimen he had seen in Alfred, and from all the
      hospitality they had shown the distressed mariners (some of whom were his
      countrymen), he had formed a favourable opinion. Half his wish was
      granted, the rest dispersed in empty air. Mrs. Falconer with alacrity
      arranged a party for Percy-hall, to show the count the scene of the
      shipwreck. She should be so glad to see it herself, for she was absent
      from the country at the time of the sad disaster; but the commissioner,
      who knew the spot, and all the circumstances, better than any other
      person, would show them every thing&mdash;and Sir Robert Percy, she was
      sure, would think himself much honoured by Count Altenberg's visiting his
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg had some confused recollection of Mr. Alfred Percy's
      having told him that his father no longer lived at Percy hall; but this
      speech of Mrs. Falconer's led the count to believe that he had
      misunderstood what Alfred had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party arranged for Percy-hall consisted of the Miss Falconers, the two
      Lady Arlingtons, and some other young people, who were at Falconer-court.
      It was a fine morning, Mrs. Falconer was all suavity and smiles, both the
      Miss Falconers in charming hopes, and consequently in charming spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy-hall was really a beautiful place, and Miss Arabella Falconer now
      looked at it with the pleasure of anticipated possession. Sir Robert Percy
      was not at home, he had been obliged that morning to be absent on some
      special business; but he had left orders with his steward and housekeeper
      to show the party of visitors the house and grounds. In going through the
      apartments they came to the gallery leading to the library, where they
      were stopped by some workmen's trestles, on which were lying two painted
      glass windows, one that had been taken down, and another which was to be
      put in its stead. Whilst the workmen were moving the obstacles out of the
      way, the company had leisure to admire the painted windows. One of them
      was covered with coats of arms: the other represented the fire at
      Percy-hall, and the portrait of Caroline assisting the old nurse down the
      staircase. This painting immediately fixed Count Altenberg's eye, and Miss
      Georgiana Falconer, not knowing whose portrait it was, exclaimed, as she
      looked at the figure of Caroline, "Beautiful! Exquisite! What a lovely
      creature that is assisting the old woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Count Altenberg, "it is one of the finest countenances I ever
      beheld."
    </p>
    <p>
      All the ladies eagerly pressed forward to look at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beautiful! Don't you think it is something like Lady Anne Cope?" said
      Miss Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! dear, no!" cried Miss Georgiana Falconer: "it is a great deal
      handsomer than any of the Copes ever were, or ever will be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has a look of Lady Mary Nesbitt," said one of the Lady Arlingtons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The eyes are so like Lady Coningsby, who is my delight," said Georgiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it has quite the Arlington nose," said Mrs. Falconer, glancing her
      eye upon the Lady Arlingtons. Count Altenberg, without moving his eye,
      repeated, "It is the most beautiful face I ever beheld."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not nearly so beautiful as the original, sir," said the painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The original?&mdash;Is it a copy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A portrait, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! a family portrait of one of our great, great grandmother Percys, I
      suppose," said Miss Georgiana, "done in her youth&mdash;in a fancy piece,
      you know, according to the taste of those times&mdash;she must have been
      superlatively lovely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma'am," said the painter, "the young lady, of whom this is a portrait,
      is, I hope and believe, now living."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?&mdash;and who can she be?&mdash;for I am sure I don't recollect
      ever having seen her in all my life&mdash;never met her in town any where&mdash;Pray,
      sir, who may it be?" added she, turning to the artist, with a mixture of
      affected negligence and real pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Caroline Percy, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A daughter of Sir Robert Percy&mdash;of the gentleman of this house?"
      said Count Altenberg eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer, and her daughter Georgiana, answered rapidly, with looks of
      alarm, as they stood a little behind the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! no, no, Count Altenberg," cried Mrs. Falconer, advancing, "not a
      daughter of the gentleman of this house&mdash;another family, relations,
      but distant relations of the commissioner's: <i>he</i> formerly knew
      something of them, but <i>we</i> know nothing of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter however knew a great deal, and seemed anxious to tell all he
      knew: but Mrs. Falconer walked on immediately, saying, "This is our way,
      is not it? This leads to the library, where, I dare say, we shall find the
      book which the count wanted." The count heard her not, for with his eyes
      fixed on the picture he was listening to the account which the painter was
      giving of the circumstance it recorded of the fire at Percy-hall&mdash;of
      the presence of mind and humanity of Miss Caroline Percy, who had saved
      the life of the poor decrepit woman, who in the picture was represented as
      leaning upon her arm. The painter paused when he came to this part of his
      story&mdash;"That woman was my mother, sir."&mdash;He went on, and with
      all the eloquence of filial affection and of gratitude, pronounced in a
      few words a panegyric on the family who had been his first and his best
      benefactors: all who heard him were touched with his honest warmth, except
      the Miss Falconers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say <i>those</i> Percys were very good people in their day," said
      Miss Falconer; "but their day is over, and no doubt you'll find, in the
      present possessor of the estate, sir, as good a patron at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist took up his pencil without making any reply, and went on with
      some heraldic devices he was painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am amazed how you could see any likeness in that face or figure to Lady
      Anne Cope, or Lady Mary Nesbitt, or any of the Arlingtons," said Miss
      Georgiana Falconer, looking through her hand at the portrait of Caroline:
      "it's the most beautiful thing I ever saw, certainly; but there's nothing
      of an air of fashion, and without that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Count Altenberg, I have found for you the very book I heard you tell the
      commissioner last night you wished so much to see," said Mrs. Falconer.
      The count went forward to receive the book, and to thank the lady for her
      polite attention; she turned over the leaves, and showed him some
      uncommonly fine prints, which he was bound to admire&mdash;and whilst he
      was admiring, Mrs. Falconer found a moment to whisper to her daughter
      Georgiana, "Not a word more about the picture: let it alone, and it is
      only a picture&mdash;dwell upon it, and you make it a reality."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Georgiana had quickness and ability sufficient to feel the value of
      her mother's knowledge of the world and of human nature, but she had
      seldom sufficient command of temper to imitate or to benefit by Mrs.
      Falconer's address. On this occasion she contented herself with venting
      her spleen on the poor painter, whose colouring and drapery she began to
      criticize unmercifully. Mrs. Falconer, however, carried off the count with
      her into the library, and kept him there, till the commissioner, who had
      been detained in the neighbouring village by some electioneering business,
      arrived; and then they pursued their walk together through the park. Miss
      Falconer was particularly delighted with the beauties of the grounds. Miss
      Georgiana, recovering her good-humour, was again charming&mdash;and all
      went on well; till they came near the sea-shore, and the count asked
      Commissioner Falconer to show him the place where the shipwreck had
      happened. She was provoked that his attention should be withdrawn from
      her, and again by these Percys. The commissioner called to one of the
      boatmen who had been ordered to be in readiness, and asked him to point
      out the place where the Dutch vessel had been wrecked. The man, who seemed
      rather surly, replied that they could not see the right place where they
      stood, and if they had a mind to see it, they must come into the boat, and
      <i>row a piece</i> up farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now some of these town-bred ladies were alarmed at the idea of going to
      sea, and though Miss Georgiana was very unwilling to be separated from the
      count, and though her mother encouraged the young lady to vanquish her
      fears as much by precept and as little by example as possible, yet when
      she was to be handed into the boat, she drew back in pretty terror, put
      her hands before her face, and protested she could not venture even with
      Count Altenberg. After as much waste of words as the discussion of such
      arrangements on a party of pleasure usually involves, it was at length
      settled that only the commissioner should accompany the count, that the
      rest of the gentlemen and ladies should pursue their walk, and that they
      should all meet again at the park-gate. The surly boatman rowed off, but
      he soon ceased to be surly when the count spoke of the humanity and
      hospitality which had been shown to some of his countrymen by Mr. Percy.
      Immediately the boatman's tongue was loosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, ay, sir, if you bees curous about <i>that</i> there gentleman, I can
      tell you a deal about him. But them as comes to see the new man does not
      covet to hear talk of the old master; but, nevertheless, there's none like
      him&mdash;he gave me and wife that there white cottage yonder, half ways
      up the bank, where you see the smoke rising between the trees&mdash;as
      snug a cottage it is!&mdash;But that is no matter to you, sir. But I wish
      you had but <i>seed</i> him the night of the shipwreck, he and his son,
      God above bless him, and them&mdash;wherever they are, if they're above
      ground. I'd row out the worse night ever we had, to set my eyes on them
      again before I die, but for a minute. Ay, that night of the shipwreck, not
      a man was willing to go out with them, or could be got out the first turn,
      but myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this text he spoke at large, entering into a most circumstantial and
      diffuse history of the shipwreck, mingling his own praises with those
      which he heartily bestowed upon the Percys of the right good old branch.
      Commissioner Falconer meantime was not in a condition to throw in any
      thing in favour of his new friend Sir Robert Percy; he was taking pinch
      after pinch of snuff, looking alternately at the water and the boat,
      sitting stiffly upright in anxious silence. Although in the incessant
      practice of suppressing his own feelings, corporeal and mental, from
      respect or complaisance to his superiors in rank and station, yet he
      presently found it beyond the utmost efforts of his courtly philosophy to
      endure his qualms of mind and body. Interrupting the talkative boatman, he
      first conjured the orator to mind what he was about; at last, Mr. Falconer
      complaining of growing very sick, the count gave up all thoughts of
      proceeding farther, and begged the boatman to put them ashore as soon as
      he could. They landed near the village, which it was necessary that they
      should pass through, before they could reach the appointed place of
      meeting. The poor commissioner, whose stomach was still disordered, and
      whose head was giddy, observed that they had yet a long walk to take, and
      proposed sending for one of the carriages&mdash;accordingly they waited
      for it at the village inn. The commissioner, after having made a multitude
      of apologies to the count, retired to rest himself&mdash;during his
      absence, the count, who, wherever he was, endeavoured to see as much as
      possible of the manners of the people, began talking to the landlord and
      landlady. Again the conversation turned upon the characters of the late
      and the present possessors of Percy-hall; and the good people, by all the
      anecdotes they told, and still more by the warm attachment they expressed
      for the old banished family, increased every moment his desire to be
      personally acquainted with those who in adversity were preferred to
      persons in present power and prosperity. Count Altenberg, young as he was,
      had seen enough of the world to feel the full value of eulogiums bestowed
      on those who are poor, and who have no means of serving in any way the
      interests of their panegyrists.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the carriage came, and the commissioner was sufficiently refitted for
      conversation, the count repeatedly expressed his earnest wish to become
      acquainted with that Mr. Percy and his family, to whom his countrymen had
      been so much obliged, and of whom he said he had this morning heard so
      many interesting anecdotes. The commissioner had not been present when the
      count saw the picture of Caroline, nor indeed did he enter into Mrs.
      Falconer's matrimonial designs for her daughter Georgiana. The
      commissioner generally saw the folly, and despaired of the success, of all
      castle-building but his own, and his castles in the air were always on a
      political plan. So without difficulty he immediately replied that nothing
      would give him more pleasure than to introduce the count to his relations,
      the Percys. The moment this was mentioned, however, to Mrs. Falconer, the
      commissioner saw through the complacent countenance, with which she forced
      herself to listen to him, that he had made some terrible blunder, for
      which he should have to answer in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly the first moment they were alone, Mrs. Falconer reproached him
      with the rash promise he had made. "I shall have all the difficulty in the
      world to put this out of the count's head. I thought, Mr. Falconer, that
      you had agreed to let <i>those</i> Percys drop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I would if I could, my dear; but how can I, when Lord Oldborough
      persists in holding them up?&mdash;You must go and see them, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I!" cried Mrs. Falconer, with a look of horror; "I!&mdash;not I, indeed!
      Lord Oldborough holds up only the gentlemen of the family&mdash;his
      lordship has nothing to do with the ladies, I suppose. Now, you know
      visiting can go on vastly well, to all eternity, between the gentlemen of
      a family without the ladies having any sort of intimacy or acquaintance
      even. You and Mr. Percy&mdash;if it is necessary for appearance sake with
      Lord Oldborough&mdash;may continue upon the old footing; but I charge you,
      commissioner, do not involve me&mdash;and whatever happens, don't take
      Count Altenberg with you to the Hills."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I have my reasons. You were not in the gallery at Percy-hall
      this morning, when the count saw that painted glass window?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner begged an explanation; but when he had heard all Mrs.
      Falconer's reasons, they did not seem to strike him with the force she
      desired and expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do as you please, my dear," said he, "and, if I can, I will make
      the count forget my promised introduction to the Percys; but all the time,
      depend upon it, your fears and your hopes are both equally vain. You
      ladies are apt to take it for granted that men's heads are always running
      on love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young men's heads sometimes are," said Mrs. Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very seldom in these days," said the commissioner. "And love altogether,
      as one should think you might know by this time, Mrs. Falconer&mdash;a
      sensible woman of the world, as you are; but no woman, even the most
      sensible, can ever believe it&mdash;love altogether has surprisingly
      little to do in the real management and business of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surprisingly little," replied Mrs. Falconer, placidly. "But seriously, my
      dear, here is an opportunity of making an excellent match for Georgiana,
      if you will be so obliging as not to counteract me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the last man in the world to counteract you, my dear; but it will
      never do," said Mr. Falconer; "and you will only make Georgiana
      ridiculous, as she has been several times already, from the failure of
      these love-matches. I tell you, Mrs. Falconer, Count Altenberg is no more
      thinking of love than I am&mdash;nor is he a man in the least likely to
      fall in love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is more than half in love with my Georgiana already," said the mother,
      "if I have any eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have eyes, and very fine eyes, my dear, as every body knows, and no
      one better than myself&mdash;they have but one defect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Defect!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They sometimes see more than exists."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would not be so incredulous, Mr. Falconer, if you had seen the
      rapture with which the count listens to Georgiana when she plays on the
      harp. He is prodigiously fond of music."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And of painting too," said the commissioner; "for, by your account of the
      matter, he seemed to have been more than half in love also with a picture
      this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A picture is no very dangerous rival, except in a <i>modern novel</i>,"
      replied Mrs. Falconer. "But beware, commissioner&mdash;and remember, I
      understand these things&mdash;I warn you in time&mdash;beware of the
      original of that picture, and never again talk to me of going to see those
      Percys; for though the girl may be only an unfashioned country beauty, and
      Georgiana has so many polished advantages, yet there is no knowing what
      whim a young man might take into his head."
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner, though he remained completely of his own opinion, that
      Mrs. Falconer's scheme for Georgiana would never do, disputed the point no
      farther, but left the room, promising all she required, for promises cost
      him nothing. To do him justice, he recollected and endeavoured to the best
      of his power to keep his word; for the next morning he took his time so
      well to propose a ride to the Hills, just at the moment when Lord
      Oldborough and the count were deep in a conversation on the state of
      continental politics, that his lordship would not part with him. The
      commissioner paid his visit alone, and Mrs. Falconer gave him credit for
      his address; but scarcely had she congratulated herself, when she was
      thrown again into terror&mdash;the commissioner had suggested to Lord
      Oldborough the propriety and policy of giving, whilst he was in the
      country, a <i>popularity ball</i>! His lordship assented, and Mrs.
      Falconer, as usual, was to take the trouble off his hands, and to give an
      entertainment, to his lordship's friends. Lord Oldborough had not yet
      recovered from the gout, and he was glad to accept of her offer: his
      lordship not being able to appear, or to do the honours of the fête, was a
      sufficient apology for his not giving it at Clermont-park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The obsequious commissioner begged to have a list of any friends whom Lord
      Oldborough particularly wished to have invited; but his lordship, with a
      look of absence, replied, that he left all that entirely to Mrs. Falconer;
      however, the very evening of the day on which the commissioner paid his
      visit alone at the Hills, Lord Oldborough put into his hands a list of the
      friends whom he wished should be invited to the ball, and at the head of
      his list were the Percys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Percys! the very people I first thought of!" said Mr. Falconer,
      commanding his countenance carefully: "but I fear we cannot hope to have
      them, they are at such a distance, and they have no carriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any of my carriages, all of them, shall be at their command," said Lord
      Oldborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner reported this to Mrs. Falconer, observing that he had
      gone to the very brink of offending Lord Oldborough to oblige her, as he
      knew by his lordship's look and tone of voice; and that nothing now could
      be done, but to visit the Percys, and as soon as possible, and to send
      them a card of invitation for the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, my dear, whatever you do, I am sure will be done with a good grace,"
      added the commissioner, observing that his lady looked excessively
      discomfited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, commissioner; you will have your daughter upon your hands,
      that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be as sorry for that, my love, as you could be; but what can be
      done? we must not lose the substance in running after the shadow. Lord
      Oldborough might turn short round upon us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the least likely upon such a trifling occasion as this, where no
      politics are in question. What can Mrs. or Miss Percy's being or not being
      at this ball signify to Lord Oldborough?&mdash;a man who never in his life
      thought of balls or cared any thing about women, and these are women whom
      he has never seen. What interest can it possibly be of Lord Oldborough's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell you, my dear&mdash;I don't see any immediate interest. But
      there's an old private friendship in the case. Some way or other, I
      declare I cannot tell you how, that old cousin Percy of mine has contrived
      to get nearer to Lord Oldborough than any one living ever could do&mdash;nearer
      to his heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heart!&mdash;Private friendship!" repeated Mrs. Falconer, with a tone of
      ineffable contempt. "Well, I only wish you had said nothing about the
      matter to Lord Oldborough; I could have managed it myself. Was there ever
      such want of address! When you saw the Percys at the head of the list, was
      that a time to say any thing about your fears of their not coming? Do you
      think Lord Oldborough could not translate fears into hopes? Then to
      mention their having no carriages!&mdash;when, if you had kept your own
      counsel, that would have been our sufficient excuse at last. They must
      have refused: nothing need have been said about it till the night of the
      ball; and I would lay my life, Lord Oldborough would never, in the mean
      time, have thought of it, or of them. But so silly! to object in that way,
      when you know that the slightest contradiction wakens Lord Oldborough's
      will, and then indeed you might as well talk to his own Jupiter Tonans. If
      his lordship had set a beggar-woman's name at the head of his list, and
      you had objected that she had no carriage, he would directly have answered
      'She shall have mine.' Bless me! It's wonderful that people can pique
      themselves on address, and have so little knowledge of character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," said the commissioner, "if you reproach me from this time till
      to-morrow, the end of the matter will be, that you must go and see the
      Percys. I say, Mrs. Falconer," added he, assuming a peremptory tone, for
      which he had acquired a taste from Lord Oldborough, but had seldom courage
      or opportunity to indulge in it, "I say, Mrs. Falconer, the thing must be
      done." He rang the bell in a gloriously authoritative manner, and ordered
      the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A visit paid thus upon compulsion was not likely to be very agreeable; but
      the complaints against the roads, the dreadful distance, and the horrid
      necessity of being civil, need not be recorded. Miss Falconers exclaimed
      when they at last came to the Hills, "La! I did not think it was so
      tolerable a place!" Miss Georgiana hoped that they should, at least, see
      Miss Caroline&mdash;she owned she was curious to see that beautiful
      original, of whom the painter at Percy Hall, and her brother Buckhurst,
      had said so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Percy and Rosamond only were at home. Caroline had taken a walk with
      her father to a considerable distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer, who had, by this time, completely recovered her
      self-command, presented herself with such smiling grace, and expressed, in
      such a tone of cordiality, her earnest desire, now that she had been so
      happy as to get into the country, to enjoy the society of her friends and
      relations, that Rosamond was quite charmed into a belief of at least half
      of what she said. Rosamond was willing to attribute all that had appeared,
      particularly of late, in contradiction of this lady's present professions,
      to some political motives of Commissioner Falconer, whom she disliked for
      his conduct to Buckhurst, and whom she was completely willing to give up
      as a worldly-minded courtier. But whilst the manners of the mother
      operated thus with Rosamond in favour of her moral character, even
      Rosamond's easy faith and sanguine benevolence could not see or hear any
      thing from the daughters that confirmed Mrs. Falconer's flattering
      speeches; they sat in languid silence, looking upon the animate and
      inanimate objects in the room with the same air of supercilious
      listlessness. They could not speak so as to be heard, they could not
      really understand any thing that Rosamond said to them; they seemed as if
      their bodies had been brought into the room by mistake, and their souls
      left behind them: not that they were in the least timid or abashed; no,
      they seemed fully satisfied with their own inanity, and proud to show that
      they had absolutely no ideas in common with those into whose company they
      had been thus unfortunately compelled. Once or twice they turned their
      heads with some signs of vivacity, when the door opened, and when they
      expected to see Miss Caroline Percy enter: but though the visit was
      protracted, in hopes of her return, yet at last they were obliged to
      depart without having their curiosity satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer's fears of rivalship for her Georgiana were not diminished
      by this visit. By those of the family whom she saw this day, she judged of
      Caroline, whom she had not seen; and she had tact sufficient to apprehend,
      that the conversation and manners of Mrs. Percy and of Rosamond were such
      as might, perhaps, please a well-bred and well-informed foreigner better,
      even, than the fashionable tone and air of the day, of which he had not
      been long enough in England to appreciate the conventional value. Still
      Mrs. Falconer had a lingering hope that some difficulties about dress, or
      some happy cold, might prevent these dangerous Percys from accepting the
      invitation to the ball. When their answers to her card came, she gave one
      hasty glance at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will do themselves the honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you are alarming yourself unnecessarily," cried the
      commissioner, who pitied the distress visible, at least to his eyes, in
      her countenance; or who feared, perhaps, a renewal of reproaches for his
      own want of address, "quite unnecessarily, believe me. I have had a great
      deal of conversation with Count Altenberg since I spoke of him to you
      last, and I am confirmed in my opinion that he merely feels the curiosity
      natural to an enlightened traveller to become acquainted with Mr. Percy, a
      man who has been described to him as a person of abilities. And he wants
      to thank him in the name of his countrymen, who were assisted, you know I
      told you, by the Percys, at the time of the shipwreck. You will see, my
      dear, that the ladies of the family will be nothing to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer sighed, and bit her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In half an hour's conversation, I would engage to find out the ruling
      passion of any man, young or old. Now, remember I tell you, Mrs. Falconer,
      Count Altenberg's ruling passion is ambition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ruling passion!" repeated Mrs. Falconer; "one of your book-words, and
      book-notions, that are always misleading you in practice. Ruling passion!&mdash;Metaphysical
      nonsense! As if men were such consistent creatures as to be ruled
      regularly by one passion&mdash;when often ten different passions pull a
      man, even before your face, ten different ways, and one cannot tell one
      hour what will be the ruling passion of the next. Tell me the reigning
      fashion, and I will tell you the ruling passion!&mdash;Luckily," continued
      Mrs. Falconer, after a pause of deep consideration, "Georgiana is very
      fashionable&mdash;one of the most fashionable young women in England, as
      the count might have seen when he was in London. But then, on the other
      hand, whether he is judge enough of English manners&mdash;Georgiana must
      be well dressed&mdash;and I know the Count's taste in dress; I have made
      myself mistress of that&mdash;commissioner, I must trouble you for some
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Falconer, I have no money; and if I had," said the commissioner, who
      always lost his temper when that subject was touched upon, "if I had, I
      would not give it to you to throw away upon such a losing game&mdash;a
      nonsensical speculation! Georgiana has not the least chance, nor has any
      other English woman, were she as handsome as Venus and dressed in bank
      notes&mdash;why, Mrs. Falconer, since you put me in a passion, I must tell
      you a secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      But checking himself, Mr. Falconer stood for a moment silent, and went on
      with "Count Altenberg has made up his quarrel with the hereditary prince,
      and I have it from undoubted authority, that he is to be the prince's
      prime minister when he comes to the throne; and the present prince, you
      know, as Cunningham says, is so infirm and asthmatic, that he may be
      carried off at any moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well&mdash;very likely&mdash;I am glad of it," said Mrs. Falconer:
      "but where's the secret?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've thought better of that, and I cannot tell it to you. But this much I
      tell you positively, Mrs. Falconer, that you will lose your labour, if you
      speculate upon the Count for Georgiana."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he married? Answer me that question, and I will ask no more&mdash;and
      that I have a right to ask."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;not married; but I can tell no more. Only let me beg that you
      will just put all love notions out of Georgiana's head and your own, or
      you'll make the girl ridiculous, and expose yourself, my dear. But, on the
      other hand, let there be no deficiency of attention to the count, for all
      our civilities to him will pay a hundred fold, and, perhaps, sooner than
      you expect&mdash;for he may be prime minister and prime favourite at
      Cunningham's court in a month, and of course will have it in his power to
      forward Cunningham's interests. That is what I look to, Mrs. Falconer; for
      I am long-sighted in my views, as you will find."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, time will show. I am glad you tell me he positively is not
      married," concluded Mrs. Falconer: "as to the rest, we shall see."

      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The evening appointed for Mrs. Falconer's ball at length arrived; and all
      the neighbouring gentry assembled at Falconer-court. They were received by
      Mrs. Falconer in a splendid saloon, newly furnished for this occasion,
      which displayed in its decorations the utmost perfection of modern taste
      and magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer was fitted, both by art and nature, to adorn a ball-room,
      and conduct a ball. With that ease of manner which a perfect knowledge of
      the world and long practice alone can give, she floated round the circle,
      conscious that she was in her element. Her eye, with one glance, seemed to
      pervade the whole assembly; her ear divided itself amongst a multitude of
      voices; and her attention diffused itself over all with equal grace. Yet
      that attention, universal as it seemed, was nicely discriminative.
      Mistress of the art of pleasing, and perfectly acquainted with all the
      shades of politeness, she knew how to dispose them so as to conceal their
      boundaries, and even their gradation, from all but the most skilful
      observers. They might, indeed, have formed, from Mrs. Falconer's reception
      of each of her guests, an exact estimate of their rank, fashion, and
      consequence in the world; for by these standards she regulated her
      opinion, and measured her regard. Every one present knew this to be her
      theory, and observed it to be her practice towards others; but each
      flattered themselves by turns that they discovered in her manner a
      personal exception in their own favour. In the turn of her countenance,
      the tone of her voice, her smile or her anxiety, in her distant respect or
      her affectionate familiarity, some distinction was discerned peculiar to
      each individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Miss Falconers, stationary at one end of the room, seemed to have
      adopted manners diametrically opposite to those of their mother:
      attraction being the principle of the mother, repulsion of the daughters.
      Encircled amongst a party of young female friends, Miss Falconers, with
      high-bred airs, confined to their own <i>coterie</i> their exclusive
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left to their mother the responsibility and all the labour of <i>doing
      the honours</i> of her own house, whilst they enjoyed the glory of being
      remarked and <i>wondered at</i> by half the company; a circumstance which,
      far from embarrassing, seemed obviously to increase their gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ball could not begin till the band of a regiment, quartered in the
      neighbourhood, arrived. Whilst they were waiting for the music, the Miss
      Falconers and their party stationed themselves directly opposite to the
      entrance of the saloon, so as to have a full view of the antechamber
      through which the company were to pass&mdash;no one passed uncensured by
      this confederacy. The first coup-d'oeil decided the fate of all who
      appeared, and each of the fair judges vied with the others in the severity
      of the sentence pronounced on the unfortunate persons who thus came before
      their merciless tribunal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I am astonished the Percys do not make their appearance," cried Miss
      Georgiana Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Sir Robert Percy any one with him?" asked one of the young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not speaking of Sir Robert Percy," replied Miss Georgiana, "but of
      the other branch, the fallen branch of the Percys&mdash;our relations too&mdash;but
      we know nothing of them&mdash;only mamma was obliged to ask them for
      to-night&mdash;And, Bell, only conceive how horribly provoking! because
      they come, we sha'n't have Sir Robert Percy&mdash;just sent to excuse
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abominable! Now, really!&mdash;And for people quite out of the world,
      that nobody ever heard of, except Lord Oldborough, who, ages ago, had some
      political connexion, I think they say, with the father," said Miss
      Arabella.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, they met abroad, or something of that sort," replied Miss Georgiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was that it? Very likely&mdash;I know nothing about them: I only wish
      they had stayed at home, where they are so fond of staying, I hear. You
      know, Georgiana, Buckhurst told us, that when they had something to live
      upon they never lived like other people, but always were buried alive in
      the country; and Lady Jane Granville, with her own lips, told me, that,
      even since they lost their fortune, she had asked one of these girls to
      town with her and to Tunbridge&mdash;Now only conceive how kind! and what
      an advantage that would have been&mdash;And, can you believe it? Mr. Percy
      was so unaccountable, and they all so odd, that they refused&mdash;Lady
      Jane, of course, will never ask them again. But now, must not they be the
      silliest creatures in the universe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silly! Oh! dear, no: there you are wrong, Bell; for you know they are all
      so wise, and so learned, so blue, such a deep blue, and all that sort of
      thing, that, for my part, I shall never dare to open my lips before them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fortunately," said one of the young ladies, "you have not much to fear
      from their learning at a ball; and as dancers I don't apprehend you have
      much to dread from any of them, even from <i>the beauty</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, scarcely," said Miss Georgiana; "I own I shall be curious to see how
      they will <i>get on&mdash;'comment ces savantes se tireront d'affaire</i>.'
      I wonder they are not here. Keep your eye on the door, dear Lady Frances&mdash;I
      would not miss their entrée for millions."
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain eyes and glasses were fixed in expectation of the arrival of these
      devoted objects of ridicule&mdash;another, and another, and another came,
      but not the Percys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The band was now ready, and began to play&mdash;Count Altenberg entered
      the room. Quick as grace can venture to move, Mrs. Falconer glided to
      receive him. Miss Georgiana Falconer, at the same moment, composed her
      features into their most becoming position, and gave herself a fine air of
      the head. The Count bowed to her&mdash;she fanned herself, and her eye
      involuntarily glanced, first at a brilliant star he wore, and then at her
      mother, whilst, with no small degree of anxiety, she prepared to play off,
      on this decisive evening, all her artillery, to complete her conquest&mdash;to
      complete her victory, for she flattered herself that only the finishing
      blow was wanting. In this belief her female companions contributed to
      confirm her, though probably they were all the time laughing at her
      vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer requested Count Altenberg to open the ball with Lady Frances
      Arlington. After having obeyed her orders, he next led out Miss Georgiana
      Falconer, evidently to her satisfaction; the more so, as she was conscious
      of being, at that moment, the envy of at least half the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg, quite unconscious of being himself the object of any
      attention, seemed to think only of showing his partner to advantage; if he
      danced well, it appeared to be only because he habitually moved with ease
      and dignity, and that whatever he did he looked like a gentleman. His fair
      partner danced admirably, and now surpassed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was repeated to Mrs. Falconer, that Colonel Bremen, the Count's friend,
      had told some one that the Count had declared he had never seen any thing
      equal to Miss Georgiana Falconer, except at the opera at Paris. At this
      triumphant moment Miss Georgiana could have seen, with security and
      complacency, the arrival of Miss Caroline Percy. The more prudent mother,
      however, was well satisfied with her absence. Every thing conspired to
      Mrs. Falconer's satisfaction. The ball was far advanced, and no Percys
      appeared. Mrs. Falconer wondered, and deplored, and at length it came near
      the hour when supper was ordered&mdash;the commissioner inquired whether
      Mrs. Falconer was certain that she had named the right day on the card?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! certain&mdash;But it is now so late, I am clear they will not be here
      to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very extraordinary, to keep Lord Oldborough's carriage and servants!"
      said the commissioner: "they went in time, I am sure, for I saw them set
      out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I know is, that we have done every thing that is proper," said Mrs.
      Falconer, "and Lord Oldborough cannot blame us&mdash;as to the Count, he
      seems quite <i>content</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer's accent seemed to imply something more than <i>content</i>;
      but this was not a proper time or place to contest the point. The husband
      passed on, saying to himself "Absurd!" The wife went on, saying
      "Obstinate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg had led his partner to a seat, and as soon as he quitted
      her, the young ladies of her party all flattered her, in congratulatory
      whispers: one observed that there was certainly something very particular
      in Count Altenberg's manner, when he first spoke to Miss Georgiana
      Falconer; another remarked that he always spoke to Miss Georgiana Falconer
      with emotion and embarrassment; a third declared that her eye was fixed
      upon the Count, and she saw him several times change colour&mdash;all, in
      short, agreed that the Count's heart was Miss Georgiana Falconer's devoted
      prize. She the while, with well-affected incredulity and secret
      complacency, half repressed and half encouraged these remarks by frequent
      exclamations of "La! how can you think so!&mdash;Why will you say such
      things!&mdash;Dear! how can you be so tormenting&mdash;so silly, now, to
      have such fancies!&mdash;But did he really change colour?"&mdash;In love
      with her! She wondered how such an idea could ever come into their heads&mdash;she
      should, for her part, never have dreamed of such a thing&mdash;indeed, she
      was positive they were mistaken. Count Altenberg in love with her!&mdash;Oh,
      no, there could be nothing in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst she spoke, her eyes followed the Count, who, quite unconscious of
      his danger, undisturbed by any idea of Miss Georgiana Falconer and love,
      two ideas which probably never had entered his mind together, was
      carelessly walking down the room, his thoughts apparently occupied with
      the passing scene. He had so much the habit of observing men and manners,
      without appearing to observe them, that, under an air of gaiety, he
      carried his understanding, as it were, incognito. His observation glanced
      on all the company as he passed. Miss Georgiana Falconer lost sight of him
      as he reached the end of the saloon; he disappeared in the antechamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards a report reached her that the Percy family were arrived;
      that Count Altenberg had been particularly struck by the sight of one of
      the Miss Percys, and had been overheard to whisper to his friend Colonel
      Bremen, "Very like the picture! but still more <i>mind</i> in the
      countenance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At hearing this, Miss Georgiana Falconer grew first red and then turned
      pale; Mrs. Falconer, though scarcely less confounded, never changed a
      muscle of her face, but leaving every body to choose their various
      comments upon the Count's words, and simply saying, "Are the Percys come
      at last?" she won her easy way through the crowd, whispering to young
      Petcalf as she passed, "Now is your time, Petcalf, my good creature&mdash;Georgiana
      is disengaged."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Mrs. Falconer got to the antechamber, another report met her, "that
      the Percys had been overturned, and had been terribly hurt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Overturned!&mdash;terribly hurt!&mdash;Good Heavens!" cried Mrs.
      Falconer, as she entered the antechamber. But the next person told her
      they were not in the least hurt&mdash;still pressing forward, she
      exclaimed, "Mrs. Percy! Where is Mrs. Percy? My dear madam! what has
      happened? Come the wrong road, did you?&mdash;broken bridge&mdash;And were
      you really overturned?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, only obliged to get out and walk a little way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I am sorry&mdash;But I am so glad to see you all safe!&mdash;When it
      grew late, I grew so uneasy!" Then turning towards Caroline, "Miss
      Caroline Percy, I am sure, though I had never, till now, the pleasure of
      seeing her."
    </p>
    <p>
      An introduction of Caroline by Mrs. Percy, in due form, took place. Mrs.
      Falconer next recognized Mr. Percy, declared he did not look a day older
      than when she had seen him fifteen years before&mdash;then recurring to
      the ladies, "But, my dear Mrs. Percy, are you sure that your shoes are not
      wet through?&mdash;Oh! my dear madam, Miss Percy's are terribly wet! and
      Miss Caroline's!&mdash;Positively, the young ladies must go to my
      dressing-room&mdash;the shoes must be dried." Mrs. Falconer said that
      perhaps her daughters could accommodate the Miss Percys with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that Rosamond protested her shoes were not wet, and that
      her sister's were perfectly dry; a few specks on their white justified
      Mrs. Falconer's apprehensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is my Arabella? If there was any body I could venture to trouble&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg instantly offered his services. "Impossible to trouble
      you, Count! But since you are so very good, perhaps you could find one of
      my daughters for me&mdash;Miss Falconer&mdash;if you are so kind, sir&mdash;Georgiana
      I am afraid is dancing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Falconer was found, and despatched with the Miss Percys, in spite of
      all they could say to the contrary, to Mrs. Falconer's dressing-room.
      Rosamond was permitted, without much difficulty, to do as she pleased; but
      Mrs. Falconer's infinite fears lest Caroline should catch her death of
      cold could not be appeased, till she had submitted to change her shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Caroline!" said Rosamond, in a low voice, "Caroline! do not put on those
      shoes&mdash;they are too large&mdash;you will never be able to dance in
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that&mdash;but I am content. It is better to yield than to debate
      the point any longer," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they returned to the ball-room, Count Altenberg was in earnest
      conversation with Mr. Percy; but Mrs. Falconer observed that the Count saw
      Miss Caroline Percy the moment she re-appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now is not it extraordinary," thought she, "when Georgiana dances so
      well! is infinitely more fashionable, and so charmingly dressed!&mdash;What
      can strike him so much in this girl's appearance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not her appearance that struck him. He was too well accustomed to
      see beauty and fashion in public places to be caught at first sight by a
      handsome face, or by a young lady's exhibition of her personal graces at a
      ball; but a favourable impression had been made on his mind by what he had
      previously heard of Miss Caroline Percy's conduct and character: her
      appearance confirmed this impression precisely, because she had not the
      practised air of a professed beauty, because she did not seem in the least
      to be thinking of herself, or to expect admiration. This was really
      uncommon, and, therefore, it fixed the attention of a man like Count
      Altenberg. He asked Caroline to dance; she declined dancing. Mr. Temple
      engaged Rosamond, and the moment he led her away, the Count availed
      himself of her place, and a conversation commenced, which soon made Mrs.
      Falconer regret that Caroline had declined dancing. Though the Count was a
      stranger to the Percy family, yet there were many subjects of common
      interest of which he knew how to avail himself. He began by speaking of
      Mr. Alfred Percy, of the pleasure he had had in becoming acquainted with
      him, of the circumstance which led to this acquaintance: then he passed,
      to Lord Oldborough&mdash;to M. de Tourville&mdash;to the shipwreck. He
      paused at Percy-hall, for he felt for those to whom he was speaking. They
      understood him, but they did not avoid the subject; he then indulged
      himself in the pleasure of repeating some of the expressions of attachment
      to their old landlord, and of honest affection and gratitude, which he had
      heard from the peasants in the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer moved away the moment she foresaw this part of the
      conversation, but she was only so far removed as to prevent the necessity
      of her taking any part in it, or of appearing to hear what it might be
      awkward for her to hear, considering her intimacy with Sir Robert Percy.
      She began talking to an old lady about her late illness, of which she
      longed to hear from her own lips all the particulars; and whilst the old
      lady told her case, Mrs. Falconer, with eyes fixed upon her, and making,
      at proper intervals, all the appropriate changes of countenance requisite
      to express tender sympathy, alarm, horror, astonishment, and joyful
      congratulation, contrived, at the same time, through the whole progress of
      fever, and the administration of half the medicines in the London
      Pharmacopoeia, to hear every thing that was said by Count Altenberg, and
      not to lose a word that was uttered by Caroline. Mrs. Falconer was
      particularly anxious to know what would be said about the picture in the
      gallery at Percy-hall, with which the Count had been so much charmed. When
      he got into the gallery, Mrs. Falconer listened with breathless eagerness,
      yet still smiling on the old lady's never-ending history of her
      convalescence, and of a shawl undoubtedly Turkish, with the true,
      inestimable, inimitable, little border.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word was said of the picture&mdash;but a pause implied more to alarm
      Mrs. Falconer than could have been expressed by the most flattering
      compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer wondered why supper was so late. She sent to order that it
      might be served as soon as possible; but her man, or her gentleman cook,
      was not a person to be hurried. Three successive messengers were sent in
      vain. He knew his importance, and preserved his dignity. The caramel was
      not ready, and nothing could make him dispense with its proper appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much depended on this caramel! How much, of which the cook never
      dreamed! How much Mrs. Falconer suffered during this half hour, and
      suffered with a smiling countenance! How much, with a scowling brow, Miss
      Georgiana Falconer made poor Petcalf endure!
    </p>
    <p>
      Every thing conspired to discomfit Mrs. Falconer. She saw the manner in
      which all the principal gentry in the country, one after another,
      expressed satisfaction at meeting the Percy family. She saw the regard and
      respect with which they were addressed, notwithstanding their loss of
      fortune and station. It was quite astonishing to Mrs. Falconer. Every body
      in the rooms, except her own set of town friends, seemed <i>so strangely</i>
      interested about this family. "How provoking that I was obliged to ask
      them here!&mdash;And Count Altenberg sees and hears all this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;all this confirmed, by the testimony of their equals in rank,
      the favourable ideas he had first received of the Percys from their
      inferiors and dependants. Every person who spoke to or of Caroline&mdash;and
      he heard many speak of her who had known her from childhood&mdash;showed
      affection in their countenance and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, supper was announced, and Mrs. Falconer requested Count
      Altenberg would take Lady Frances Arlington into the supper-room. Miss
      Georgiana Falconer was anxious to sit as near as possible to her dear Lady
      Frances, and this was happily accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count was more than usually agreeable; but whether this arose from his
      desire to please the ladies who sat beside him, or those who sat opposite
      to him, those to whom he was in politeness bound to address his
      conversation, or those whose attention he might hope it would attract,
      were questions of difficult solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were returning into the ball-room, Rosamond watched her
      opportunity, made her way along a passage which led to Mrs. Falconer's
      dressing-room, seized her sister's shoes, returned with the prize before
      Caroline reached the antechamber, and, unseen by all, made her put them on&mdash;"Now
      promise me not to refuse to dance, if you are asked again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg engaged Miss Georgiana Falconer the first two dances&mdash;when
      these were finished, he asked Caroline to dance, and Mrs. Falconer, who
      dreaded the renewal of conversation between them, and who knew nothing of
      Rosamond's counter-manoeuvre about the shoes, was surprised and rejoiced
      when she saw Caroline comply, and suffer herself to be led out by Count
      Altenberg. But Miss Georgiana, who had observed that Rosamond danced well,
      had fears&mdash;the mother's hopes were disappointed, the daughter's fears
      were justified. Caroline showed all the capability of dancing without
      being a dancer, and it certainly did not escape the Count's observation
      that she possessed what is most desirable in female accomplishments, the
      power to excel without the wish to display. Immediately after she had
      finished these dances, the favour of her hand was solicited by a certain
      Colonel Spandrill. Colonel Spandrill, celebrated for his fashionable
      address and personal accomplishments, had been the hoped-for partner of
      many rival ladies, and his choice excited no small degree of emotion.
      However, it was settled that he only danced with Miss Percy because Mrs.
      Falconer had made it her particular request. One of these ladies declared
      she had overheard that request; Colonel Spandrill then was safe from all
      blame, but the full fire of their resentment was directed against poor
      Caroline. Every feature of her face was criticised, and even the minutiæ
      of her dress. They all allowed that she was handsome, but each found some
      different fault with her style of beauty. It was curious to observe how
      this secondary class of young ladies, who had without discomfiture or
      emotion seen Caroline the object of Count Altenberg's attention, were
      struck with indignation the moment they suspected her of pleasing Colonel
      Spandrill. Envy seldom takes two steps at once: it is always excited by
      the fear of losing the proximate object of ambition; it never exists
      without some mixture of hope as well as of fear. These ladies having no
      hope of captivating Count Altenberg, Caroline did not then appear to be
      their rival; but now that they dreaded her competition with a man whom
      they had hopes of winning, they pulled her to pieces without mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Miss Falconers and their quadrille-set were resting themselves, whilst
      this country dance was going on. Miss Georgiana was all the time
      endeavouring to engage Count Altenberg in conversation. By all the modern
      arts of coquetry, so insipid to a man of the world, so contemptible to a
      man of sense, she tried to recall the attention of the Count. Politeness
      obliged him to seem to listen, and he endeavoured to keep up that kind of
      conversation which is suited to a ball-room; but he relapsed continually
      into reverie, till at last, provoked by his absence of mind, Miss
      Georgiana, unable to conceal her vexation, unjustly threw the blame upon
      her health. She complained of the headache, of heat, of cold, of country
      dances&mdash;such barbarous things!&mdash;How could any one bear any thing
      but quadrilles? Then the music&mdash;the band was horrid!&mdash;they
      played vastly too fast&mdash;shocking! there was no such thing as keeping
      time&mdash;did not Count Altenberg think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg was at that moment beating time with his foot, in exact
      cadence to Miss Caroline Percy's dancing: Miss Falconer saw this, but not
      till she had uttered her question, not till it had been observed by all
      her companions. Lady Frances Arlington half smiled, and half a smile
      instantly appeared along a whole line of young ladies. Miss Georgiana
      suddenly became sensible that she was exposed to the ridicule or sarcastic
      pity of those who but an hour before had flattered her in the grossest
      manner: she had expected to produce a great effect at this ball&mdash;she
      saw another preferred. Her spirits sunk, and even the powers of
      affectation failed. The struggle between the fine lady and the woman
      ceased. Passion always conquers art at a <i>coup de main</i>. When any
      strong emotion of the soul is excited, the natural character, temper, and
      manners seldom fail to break through all that is factitious&mdash;those
      who had seen Miss Georgiana Falconer only through the veil of affectation
      were absolutely astonished at the change that appeared when it was thrown
      aside. By the Count the metamorphosis was unnoticed, for he was intent on
      another object; but by many of the spectators it was beheld with open
      surprise, or secret contempt. She exhibited at this moment the picture of
      a disappointed coquette&mdash;the spasm of jealousy had seized her heart;
      and, unable to conceal or endure the pain in this convulsion of mind, she
      forgot all grace and decorum. Her mother from afar saw the danger at this
      crisis, and came to her relief. The danger in Mrs. Falconer's opinion was,
      that the young lady's want of temper should be seen by Count Altenberg;
      she therefore carried him off to a distant part of the room, to show him,
      as she said, "a bassoon player, who was the exact image of Hogarth's
      enraged musician."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time Colonel Spandrill and Caroline had finished their dance:
      and the colonel, who made it a principle to engross the attention of the
      prettiest woman in the room, was now, after his manner, paying his
      adorations to his fair partner. Promising himself that he should be able
      to recede or advance as he thought proper, he used a certain happy
      ambiguity of phrase, which, according to the manner in which it is
      understood, or rather according to the tone and look with which it is
      accompanied, says every thing&mdash;or nothing. With prudent caution, he
      began with darts, flames, wounds, and anguish; words which every military
      man holds himself privileged to use towards every fine woman he meets.
      Darts, flames, wounds, and anguish, were of no avail. The colonel went on,
      as far as bright eyes&mdash;bewitching smiles&mdash;and heavenly grace.
      Still without effect. With astonishment he perceived that the girl, who
      looked as if she had never heard that she was handsome, received the full
      fire of his flattery with the composure of a veteran inured to public
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer was almost as much surprised and disappointed by this as the
      colonel could be. She had purposely introduced the gallant Colonel
      Spandrill to the Miss Percys, in hopes that Caroline's head might be <i>affected</i>
      by flattery; and that she might not then retain all that dignity of manner
      which, as Mrs. Falconer had sense enough to see, was her distinguishing
      charm in the eyes of the Count. Frustrated, and dreading every instant
      that with all her address she should not be able to manage her Georgiana's
      temper, Mrs. Falconer became excessively impatient for the departure of
      the Percy family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Falconer!" cried she; "Commissioner! Mrs. Percy ordered her carriage
      a considerable time ago. They have a great way to return, and a dreadful
      road&mdash;I am uneasy about them&mdash;do pray be so good to see what
      detains her carriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner went out of the room, and a few minutes afterwards
      returned, and taking Mrs. Falconer aside, said, "I have something to tell
      you, my dear, that will surprise you&mdash;indeed I can scarcely believe
      it. Long as I have known Lord Oldborough, I never knew him do, or think of
      doing such a thing&mdash;and he ill&mdash;at least ill enough with the
      gout, for an excuse&mdash;an excuse he thought sufficient for the whole
      county&mdash;and there are people of so much more consequence&mdash;I
      protest I cannot understand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Understand what, commissioner?&mdash;Will you tell me what has happened,
      and you may be as much surprised as you please afterwards? Lord Oldborough
      has the gout," added she, in an accent which expressed "<i>Well, all the
      world knows that.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Oldborough's own confidential man Rodney, you know&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, Rodney I do know&mdash;what of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is here&mdash;I have seen him this instant&mdash;from his lord, with a
      message to Mr. Percy, to let him know that there are apartments prepared
      for him and all his family at Clermont-park; and that he insists upon
      their not returning this night to the Hills, lest the ladies should be
      tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Oldborough!" repeated Mrs. Falconer; "Lord Oldborough!&mdash;the
      ladies!&mdash;Clermont-park! where none but persons of the first
      distinction are invited!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, now you are surprised," cried the commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surprised! beyond all power of expression," said Mrs. Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beyond all power of dissimulation," she should have said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Count Altenberg, too, going to hand them to their carriage&mdash;going to
      Clermont-park with them!&mdash;I wish to Heaven," said Mrs. Falconer to
      herself, "I had never given this unfortunate ball!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer was mistaken in this idea. It was not the circumstance of
      meeting Caroline at a ball that made this impression on Count Altenberg;
      wherever he had seen her, if he had had opportunity of conversing, and of
      observing the dignity and simplicity of her manner, the same effect would
      have been produced&mdash;but in fact Mrs. Falconer's fears, and her
      daughter's jealousy, had much magnified the truth. Count Altenberg had
      not, as they fancied, fallen desperately in love at first sight with
      Caroline&mdash;he had only been pleased and interested sufficiently to
      make him desirous to see more of her. Caroline, though so much the object
      of jealousy, had not the slightest idea that she had made a conquest&mdash;she
      simply thought the count's conversation agreeable, and she was glad that
      she should see him again at breakfast the next morning.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Percy accepted of Lord Oldborough's invitation. They found
      apartments prepared for them at Clermont-park, and servants ready to
      attend, with the officious promptitude with which a great man's domestics
      usually wait upon those who are supposed to stand high in their master's
      favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his illness Lord Oldborough had always breakfasted in his own room;
      but his lordship appeared at the breakfast-table the morning after the
      ball, ready to receive his guests. Nothing could be more gracious, more
      polite, more kind, than his reception of Mr. Percy and his family. From
      the moment he was introduced to the wife and daughters of his friend, he
      seemed to throw aside the reserve and coldness of his manner&mdash;to
      forget at once the statesman and the minister, the affairs of Europe and
      the intrigues of the cabinet&mdash;to live entirely for the present moment
      and the present company. The company consisted of the Percy family, Count
      Altenberg, and Mr. Temple. It was a common practice with Lord Oldborough
      to set conversation a-going, then to become silent, and to retire to his
      own thoughts&mdash;he would just throw the ball, and leave others to run
      for it. But now he condescended at least to join in the pursuit, though
      apparently without ambition to obtain distinction in the race. After
      breakfast he showed the ladies into his library; and, as he was himself
      disabled, requested Mr. Temple to take down such books or prints as he
      thought most worthy of their attention. Literature had been neglected,
      perhaps undervalued, by Lord Oldborough, since he had devoted himself to
      politics; but he could at will recall the classical stores of his youth;
      and on modern books his quick eye and ear, joined to his strong and rapid
      judgment, enabled him to decide better than many who make it the only
      business of their lives to read. Even Mr. Percy, who knew him best, was
      surprised; and still more surprised was Mr. Temple, who had seen him in
      varieties of company, some of the highest rank and fashion both in wit and
      literature, where his lordship had appeared either absent of mind or a
      silent listener; but he now exerted those powers of conversation which he
      usually suffered to lie dormant. Instead of waiting in proud expectation
      that those who were in his company should prove their claims to his
      attention, he now produced his own intellectual treasures; evidently not
      for the vanity of display, but to encourage his guests to produce those
      talents which he seemed to take it for granted that they possessed. It
      appeared to be his sole object, his pride and pleasure, to pay attention
      to the wife and daughters of his friend; and to show them and him to
      advantage to an illustrious foreigner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said he, apart to Count Altenberg, "I am proud to show you a
      specimen of a cultivated independent country gentleman and his family."
    </p>
    <p>
      With his usual penetration, Lord Oldborough soon discerned the
      characteristics of each of the ladies of this family&mdash;the good sense
      and good breeding of Mrs. Percy, the wit and generous simplicity of
      Rosamond, the magnanimity and the superior understanding of Caroline. As
      instances of these different qualities appeared, his quick and brightening
      eye marked his approbation, sometimes by a glance at Count Altenberg, by a
      nod to Mr. Temple, or by a congratulatory smile as he turned to Mr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I now comprehend," said his lordship, "why Mr. Percy could never be
      induced to take a part in public business. Ladies, you have done a great
      injury to your country&mdash;you have made this gentleman too happy in
      domestic life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough spoke this in a tone of raillery, and with a smile&mdash;but
      the smile was succeeded by a deep sigh, and a dark gloom of countenance.
      At this moment one of his secretaries, Mr. Shaw, came in with papers to be
      signed. The minister reappeared. Lord Oldborough's mind turned instantly
      to business; he withdrew to a table apart, sat down, and began to look
      over the first paper that was laid before him. Mr. Percy rang the bell,
      and something was said about not intruding on his lordship's time&mdash;he
      looked up: "Mr. Temple, you are free. Mr. Shaw shall finish whatever
      letters it is necessary should be written this morning. You shall have the
      pleasure of being with your friends. It is a pleasure you deserve, sir,
      and can appreciate. Mrs. Percy expressed a wish to see the grounds&mdash;you
      will show them to these ladies. I am a prisoner still," said his lordship,
      looking down at his gouty hand, "and always shall be a prisoner," added
      he, turning his eye upon the papers which Mr. Shaw held.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies, accompanied by Mr. Temple, and by Count Altenberg, went out to
      walk. Mr. Percy stayed one moment to express his sense of the
      extraordinary politeness and kindness with which Lord Oldborough had
      honoured him and his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You owe me no thanks, my dear sir. Kindness can be repaid only by
      kindness. It is a species of debt, which in the course of my life I have
      seldom been called upon to pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was said not in a voice either of sentiment or of compliment, but
      rather in an austere tone, and with a stern countenance of conquered
      emotion. Without looking at Mr. Percy, he received and answered the
      farewell shake of the hand; his lips were instantly after strongly
      compressed; and, taking up his pen, the man was again absorbed in the
      minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy joined the party who were going to walk in the park. Count
      Altenberg had been unusually silent in Lord Oldborough's company: with the
      becoming deference of a young man, in the presence of one superior in age,
      and in high station, he had listened, eager to learn, instead of impatient
      to talk. Attention of course now turned upon him, as the stranger and the
      foreigner.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the same perfect taste and good-breeding with which he knew how to
      pay honour due, he received it, and appeared as much at his ease, whether
      he was in the shade or the light, whether he was unnoticed or the object
      of general attention. He had that air of self-possession, which
      characterizes a person secure of his own resources, and not afraid to
      produce his abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation turned at first upon the beauties of nature&mdash;Clermont-park
      was one of the really magnificent places in England which an Englishman
      may feel proud to show to a foreigner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg politely and justly observed how different the country
      seats of our nobility are from the ruinous and comfortless <i>chateaux</i>
      of most of the French nobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clermont-park, however, was not new to the count. Commissioner Falconer
      had the day after his arrival shown him every thing that was to be seen:
      his attention, therefore, as they pursued their walk, was not so much
      distracted by external objects as to prevent him from wishing to converse.
      Finding that Mr. Percy had travelled, he spoke of Switzerland and Italy;
      and, without any of the jargon of a connoisseur, showed that he felt with
      sensibility and enthusiasm the beautiful and sublime. It soon appeared
      that he had seen various countries, not merely with the eye of a painter
      and a poet, but of a philosophical traveller, who can allow for the
      differences of national taste, and discern how its variations are
      influenced by climate, education, government, and local circumstances. In
      his rapid panorama of foreign countries, he showed variety of knowledge,
      and without illiberal prejudice against any nation, an amiable
      predilection for his native country. Next to his own country he preferred
      England, which, as he said, by the mother's side, he might call his own.
      She had early instilled into him an admiration for our free constitution,
      and a love of our domestic habits; but he had never before visited this
      country, and he was particularly desirous to obtain an accurate knowledge
      of England, and of the manners and modes of life of its inhabitants. He
      seemed thus eager to obtain information, not merely to gratify a cursory
      or selfish curiosity, but with a view to the future, and with a hope of
      doing permanent good. It was clear that he was not only a philosophical
      but a benevolent traveller, to whom nothing that concerns his
      fellow-creatures is foreign or indifferent. His treasuring up all he had
      seen abroad, that could be useful at home, reminded Caroline of Colonel
      Hungerford; but she observed that Count Altenberg's views were more
      enlarged; he was unbiassed by professional habits; his sphere of action
      was higher; heir to extensive property, with all the foreign rights of
      territorial dominion hereditarily his; and with a probability of obtaining
      the political power of ministerial station; plans, which in other
      circumstances might have been romantic, with Count Altenberg's prospects
      and abilities, were within the bounds of sound judgment and actual
      practicability. But whatever these intentions might be, they were only to
      be inferred from his conversation; he scarcely spoke of himself, or of his
      own designs; whatever he was led to say on such subjects, he seemed,
      immediately after he had said it, to feel as an impropriety, not justified
      by the slight interest which the acquaintance of a few hours could
      inspire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He changed the conversation by asking some questions about a celebrated
      English writer. In return for the information Mr. Percy gave him, he spoke
      of some recent foreign publications&mdash;related several anecdotes of
      literary foreigners. His anecdotes were interesting, because, in each,
      there was something characteristic of the individual, or illustrative of
      some general principle of human nature. To gratify Mr. Percy, the Count
      spoke of some public events of which he had had means of obtaining
      information. He had not neglected any of the opportunities he enjoyed, and
      whether he talked of civil or military affairs, he showed the same <i>efficient</i>
      knowledge, and the same superior ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline, leaning on her father's arm, listened with a countenance full of
      intelligence, animation, and sympathy; she looked alternately at the Count
      and at her father, whose satisfaction she saw and enjoyed. Feeling that he
      was appreciated by the father, inspired by the charms of the daughter, and
      excited by the idea he had formed of her character, Count Altenberg had
      indeed been uncommonly agreeable, entertaining, and eloquent. During this
      walk, though Caroline said but little, yet that little, to a man of the
      Count's discernment, was sufficient to show good judgment and great
      capacity. This increased the admiration and interest which her beauty and
      manners, and all he had heard of her conduct, created.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said to be one of the characteristics of genius, that it is able
      quickly to discover and elicit genius, wherever it exists. It is certain
      that with the celerity of intuition, of sympathy, or of practised
      penetration, Count Altenberg perceived Caroline's intellectual
      superiority. He had been, at first, curious to discover whether her mental
      qualifications were equal to her extraordinary personal beauty; but he had
      soon forgotten his intention of trying her abilities, in anxiety to
      convince her of his own. The whole turn and style of his conversation now
      proved, more than any compliment could possibly have shown, the high
      opinion he had of her understanding, and of the elevation of her mind. A
      woman may always judge of the real estimation in which she is held, by the
      conversation which is addressed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time, where were Rosamond, Mrs. Percy, and Mr. Temple? Mr. Temple
      had taken them to see a fine view; Mr. Percy proposed to sit down and
      quietly wait their return; Caroline and the Count seemed to have no
      objection to oblige him, and they placed themselves under a spreading
      beech. They had not been seated many minutes, before they were interrupted
      by the appearance of Commissioner Falconer, who came, by a cross path,
      from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At last I have found you. What a prodigious walk you have taken!" cried
      the commissioner, wiping his forehead. "But where's Mrs. Percy and the
      rest of your party? I have so walked to catch you&mdash;rode over on
      purpose to pay my compliments to the ladies before they return home&mdash;and
      I come chargé d'affaires from Mrs. Falconer to Mrs. Percy. I must see Mrs.
      Percy&mdash;Oh! here she is, coming down the hill&mdash;ay, from the <i>point
      of view</i>&mdash;Mercy! how you have walked: I am not equal to the <i>grand
      tour</i>&mdash;it kills me. But I am so sorry I was not here time enough
      to do the honours of Clermont-park, as Lord Oldborough is confined. Who
      has Mrs. Percy for her cicerone? Ha! Mr. Temple&mdash;I thought he was
      always so busy&mdash;deputed by Lord Oldborough&mdash;really!&mdash;Hum&mdash;I
      hope Lord Oldborough did not conceive that there was any want of <i>empressement</i>
      on my part&mdash;I should have been here a full hour sooner, but that my
      ladies were so late at breakfast after sitting up&mdash;and I thought your
      ladies might have been fatigued too&mdash;but Miss Caroline Percy, I see,
      fresh as a rose&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner then, as if half in jest, half in earnest, paid Caroline
      a profusion of compliments upon her appearance the preceding night&mdash;numbered
      on his fingers the conquests she had made, and the hearts she had broken.
      Mrs. Percy, Rosamond, and Mr. Temple came up; and as soon as they had
      expressed their raptures on the beauty of this view, the commissioner
      presented his note from Mrs. Falconer to Mrs. Percy, to which, he said, he
      was most anxious to be the bearer of a favourable answer, as he knew that
      he should otherwise be ill-received at home, and the disappointment would
      be great. The note contained a pressing invitation to a play, which the
      young people at Falconer-court had it in contemplation to represent.
      Whether it was to be Zara or Cato, they had not yet positively decided&mdash;for
      Cato they were in terrible distress for a Marcia&mdash;could Miss Caroline
      Percy be prevailed upon to try Marcia? She would look the part so well,
      and, no doubt, act it so well. Or if she preferred Zara, Miss Georgiana
      Falconer would, with pleasure, take the part of the confidante. Dresses in
      great forwardness, Turkish or Roman, convertible, in a few hours' notice&mdash;should
      wait Miss Percy's decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear Caroline, what say you?" cried Mrs. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline was going to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, don't answer yet," interrupted the commissioner: "let me add,
      what I find Mrs. Falconer took it for granted I would say, that there can
      be no possible difficulty or inconvenience about the goings and comings,
      and horses and carriages, and beds, and all that sort of thing&mdash;for
      our horses and carriages can have nothing to do whilst the ladies are
      rehearsing&mdash;shall attend you any day&mdash;any hour&mdash;and beds we
      can contrive: so, I beseech you, let none of these vulgar sublunary
      considerations deprive us of a Zara or a Marcia&mdash;But say, which shall
      it be?&mdash;Which character, my charming cousin, will you do us the
      honour and pleasure to take?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg advanced a step, full of eager expectation. When he heard
      Caroline pronounce, with great politeness, a refusal, for the first moment
      he looked disappointed, but the next seemed satisfied and pleased. It
      would have highly gratified and interested him to have seen Caroline act
      either the sublime or the tender heroine, but he preferred seeing her
      support her own character with modest dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commissioner Falconer pleaded and pressed in vain; Caroline was steady in
      her refusal, though the manner of it was so gentle, that every instant he
      thought he should vanquish her reluctance. At length he turned from the
      ladies to the gentlemen for assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Temple, I am sure you will join my entreaties&mdash;Count Altenberg&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg "would not presume to ask a favour, which had been refused
      to the commissioner and to Mrs. Falconer." Caroline understood, and gave
      him credit for his politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, if I must give up this point," said the commissioner, "at least do
      not let me return disappointed in every respect&mdash;let me hope that you
      will all favour us with your company at our play."
    </p>
    <p>
      This invitation was accepted with many thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, remember, you must not run away from us that night," added the
      commissioner. "Mrs. Falconer will have reason to be jealous of
      Clermont-park, if she finds that it draws our friends and relations away
      from Falconer-court."
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage, which had been ordered to the great gate of the park, was
      now waiting there, and the commissioner took leave of his relations, with
      many shakes of the hand and many expressions of regret. Count Altenberg
      continued talking to Caroline till the last moment; and after he had
      handed her into the carriage, as he took leave of Mr. Percy, he said that
      he had to thank him and his family for some of the most agreeable among
      the many agreeable hours he had passed since he came to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their way home, this happy family-party eagerly talked over every thing
      and every body that had interested them&mdash;first and chiefly they spoke
      of Count Altenberg. Caroline said how often, during their walk, she had
      regretted her mother's and sister's absence. She recollected and reminded
      her father of some of the striking circumstances they had heard, and Mr.
      Percy and she repeated so many curious and interesting anecdotes, so many
      just observations and noble sentiments, that Mrs. Percy and Rosamond were
      quite charmed with the Count. Rosamond, however, was surprised by the
      openness and ease with which Caroline praised and talked of this
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will say nothing," thought she; "for I am determined to be prudent this
      time. But certainly here is no danger that her love should unsought be
      won. Only this I may and must think, that Caroline cannot, without
      affectation, avoid seeing that she has made a conquest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistaken again, Rosamond&mdash;Caroline had neither seen nor suspected it.
      Count Altenberg's gratitude for the hospitality shown to his countrymen at
      the time of the shipwreck, his recent acquaintance with her brother
      Alfred, and all he had heard of her father from the grateful tenants at
      Percy-hall, accounted, as Caroline justly thought, for the eagerness he
      had shown to be introduced to her family. His conversing so much with her,
      she thought, was natural, as he was a stranger to most of the company, and
      had some subjects of conversation in common with her and her family.
      Caroline was not apt to imagine admiration in every word or look; she was
      not expert in construing every compliment into a declaration or an
      innuendo of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      His conversation, during their walk, had been perfectly free from all
      compliment. It had been on subjects so interesting, that she had been
      carried on without having had time to think of love. A good and great
      character had opened to her view, and she had been so absorbed in
      sympathy, that though she had thought of nothing but Count Altenberg, she
      had never thought of him with any reference to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning after their return home, Count Altenberg came to the Hills,
      accompanied by Mr. Temple. They stayed till it was late; for the Count
      seemed to forget the hour of the day, till reminded of it by Mr. Temple.
      Caroline, in her own family, at her home, pleased Count Altenberg
      particularly. The interest he felt about her increased, and he afterwards
      took or made frequent opportunities of calling at the Hills: his
      conversation was generally addressed to Mr. Percy, but he observed
      Caroline with peculiar attention&mdash;and Rosamond was confirmed in her
      opinion. A few weeks passed in this manner, while the play was preparing
      at Falconer-court. But before we go to the play, let us take a peep behind
      the scenes, and inquire what is and has been doing by the Falconer family.
      Even they who are used to the ennui subsequent to dissipation, even they
      who have experienced the vicissitudes of coquetry, the mortifications of
      rivalship, and the despair of disappointed vanity, can scarcely conceive
      the complication of disagreeable ideas and emotions with which Miss
      Georgiana Falconer awoke the morning after the magnificent ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image of her beautiful rival disturbed her morning dreams, and stood
      before her fancy the moment she opened her eyes. Wakening, she endeavoured
      to recollect and compare all that had passed the preceding night; but
      there had been such tumult in her mind, that she had only a vague
      remembrance of the transactions: she had a confused idea that the Count
      was in love, and that he was not in love with her: she had fears that,
      during the heat of competition, she had betrayed unbecoming emotion; but
      gradually, habitual vanity predominated; her hopes brightened; she began
      to fancy that the impression made by her rival might be easily effaced,
      and that they should see no more of the fair phantom. That branch of the
      Percy family, she recollected, were to be considered only as decayed
      gentry; and she flattered herself that they would necessarily and
      immediately sink again into that obscurity from which her mother's
      ill-fated civility had raised them. Her mother, she knew, had invited
      these Percys against her will, and would be particularly careful on
      account of Sir Robert Percy (and Arabella) not to show them any further
      attention. Thus things would, in a day or two, fall again into their
      proper train. "No doubt the Count will call this morning, to know how we
      do after the ball."
    </p>
    <p>
      So she rose, and resolved to dress herself with the most becoming
      negligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very different was the result of her experienced mother's reflections.
      Mrs. Falconer saw that her daughter's chance of the Count was now scarcely
      worth considering; that it must be given up at once, to avoid the danger
      of utter ruin to other speculations of a more promising kind. The mother
      knew the unmanageable violence of her daughter's temper: she had seen her
      Georgiana expose herself the preceding night at the ball to her particular
      friends, and Mrs. Falconer knew enough of the world to dread reports
      originating from particular friends; she dreaded, also, that on some
      future similar occasion, the young lady's want of command over her
      jealousy should produce some terribly ridiculous scene, confirm the report
      that she had an unhappy passion for Count Altenberg, stigmatize her as a
      forlorn maiden, and ruin her chance of any other establishment. In this
      instance she had been misled by her own and her daughter's vanity. It was
      mortifying, to be sure, to find that she had been wrong; and still more
      provoking to be obliged to acknowledge that Mr. Falconer was right; but in
      the existing circumstances it was absolutely necessary, and Mrs. Falconer,
      with a species of satisfaction, returned to her former habits of thinking,
      and resumed certain old schemes, from which the arrival of the Count had
      diverted her imagination. She expected the two Mr. Clays at Falconer-court
      the next day. Either of them, she thought, might be a good match for
      Georgiana. To be sure, it was said that French Clay had gaming debts to a
      large amount upon his hands&mdash;this was against him; but, in his
      favour, there was the chance of his elder brother's dying unmarried, and
      leaving him Clay-hall. Or, take it the other way, and suppose English Clay
      to be made the object&mdash;he was one of the men who professedly have a
      horror of being taken in to marry; yet no men are more likely "to run into
      the danger to avoid the apprehension." Suppose the worst, and that neither
      of the Clays could be worked to any good purpose, Mrs. Falconer had still
      in reserve that <i>pis aller</i> Petcalf, whose father, the good general,
      was at Bath, with the gout in his stomach; and if he should die, young
      Petcalf would pop into possession of the general's lodge in <i>Asia Minor</i>
      [Footnote: A district in England so called.]: not so fine a place, to be
      sure, nor an establishment so well appointed as Clay-hall; but still with
      a nabob's fortune a great deal might be done&mdash;and Georgiana might
      make Petcalf throw down the lodge and build. So at the worst she might
      settle very comfortably with young Petcalf, whom she could manage as she
      pleased, provided she never let him see her <i>penchant</i> for Count
      Altenberg. Mrs. Falconer determined to turn the tables dexterously, and to
      make it appear that the Count admired Georgiana, but saw she could not be
      induced to leave England. "We must," said she to herself, "persuade
      English Clay that I would not for any consideration give my daughter to a
      foreigner."
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of these plans and reflections, Mrs. Falconer began her new
      system of operations, by writing that note full of superfluous civility to
      Mrs. Percy, with which Commissioner Falconer had been charged: the
      pressing Caroline to play Zara or Marcia, the leaving to her the choice of
      dresses and characters, the assurance that Miss Georgiana Falconer would
      take the confidante's part with pleasure, were all strokes of Mrs.
      Falconer's policy. By these means she thought she could most effectually
      do away all suspicion of her own or her daughter's jealousy of Miss
      Caroline Percy. Mrs. Falconer foresaw that, in all probability, Caroline
      would decline acting; but if she had accepted, Mrs. Falconer would have
      been sincerely pleased, confident, as she was, that Caroline's inferiority
      to her Georgiana, who was an accomplished actress, would be conspicuously
      manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Mrs. Percy's answer, and Caroline's refusal, arrived, Mrs.
      Falconer went to her daughter Georgiana's apartment, who was giving
      directions to her maid, Lydia Sharpe, about some part of Zara's dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," said Mrs. Falconer, looking carelessly at the dress, "you won't
      want a very expensive dress for Zara."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, ma'am, I shall," cried Georgiana: "Zara will be nothing, unless
      she is well dressed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, you must manage as well as you can with Lydia Sharpe. Your
      last court-dress surely she can make do vastly well, with a little
      alteration to give it a Turkish air."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! dear me, ma'am!&mdash;a little alteration!" cried Lydia: "no
      alteration upon the face of Heaven's earth, that I could devise from this
      till Christmas, would give it a Turkish air. You don't consider, nor
      conceive, ma'am, how <i>skimping</i> these here court-trains are now&mdash;for
      say the length might answer, its length without any manner of breadth, you
      know, ma'am&mdash;look, ma'am, a mere strip!&mdash;only two breadths of
      three quarters bare each&mdash;which gives no folds in nature, nor
      drapery, nor majesty, which, for a Turkish queen, is indispensably
      requisite, I presume."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another breadth or two would make it full enough, and cotton velvet will
      do, and come cheap," said Mrs. Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cotton velvet!" cried Miss Georgiana. "I would not wear cotton velvet&mdash;like
      the odious, shabby Miss Chattertons, who are infamous for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But on the stage, what eye could detect it, child?" said Mrs. Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eye, ma'am! no, to be sure, at that distance: but the first touch to any
      body that understands velvets would betray it&mdash;and them that is on
      the stage along with Miss Georgiana, or behind the scenes, will detect it.
      And I understood the ladies was to sup in their dresses, and on such an
      occasion I presumed you would like Miss Georgiana to have an entire <i>cap
      a pie</i> new dress, as the Lady Arlingtons and every body has seen her
      appear in this, and has it by heart, I may say&mdash;and the Count too,
      who, of course, will expect, to see Zara spick and span&mdash;But I leave
      it all to your own better judgment, ma'am&mdash;I am only just mentioning&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I know is, that the play will be nothing unless it is well dressed,"
      cried Miss Georgiana; "and I never will play Zara in old trumpery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, there's your amber satin, or your pink, or your green, or
      your white, or&mdash;I am sure you have dresses enough. Lydia, produce
      them, and let me see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia covered the bed with various finery; but to every dress that was
      produced some insuperable objection was started by the young lady or by
      her maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember you had a lavender satin, that I do not see here, Georgiana,"
      said Mrs. Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The colour did not become me, ma'am, and I sold it to Lydia."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sold! gave</i>, perhaps some innocent reader may suspect that the young
      lady meant to say.&mdash;No: this buying and selling of finery now goes on
      frequently between a certain class of fashionable maids and mistresses;
      and some young ladies are now not ashamed to become old clothes-women.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vastly well," said Mrs. Falconer, smiling; "you have your own ways and
      means, and I am glad of it, for I can tell you there is no chance of my
      getting you any money from your father; I dare not speak to him on that
      subject&mdash;for he was extremely displeased with me about Mrs. Sparkes'
      last bill: so if you want a new dress for Zara, you and Lydia Sharpe must
      settle it as well as you can between you. I will, in the mean time, go and
      write a note, while you make your bargain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bargain! Me, ma'am!" cried Lydia Sharpe, as Mrs. Falconer left the room;
      "I am the worst creature extant at bargaining, especially with ladies. But
      any thing I can do certainly to accommodate, I shall, I'm sure, be happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then," said Miss Georgiana, "if you take this white satin off my
      hands, Lydia, I am sure I shall be happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no objection, ma'am&mdash;that is, I'm in duty bound to make no
      manner of objections," said Lydia, with a very sentimental air, hanging
      her head aside, and with one finger rubbing her under-lip slowly, as she
      contemplated the white satin, which her young mistress held up for sale.
      "I am really scrupulous&mdash;but you're sensible, Miss Georgiana, that
      your white satin is so all frayed with the crape sleeves. Lady Trant
      recommended&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only a very little frayed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But in the front breadth, ma'am; you know that makes a world of
      difference, because there's no hiding, and with satin no turning&mdash;and
      not a bit neither to new body."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The body is perfectly good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg pardon for observing, but you know, ma'am, you noticed yourself how
      it was blacked and soiled by wearing under your black lace last time, and
      that you could not wear it again on that account."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I!&mdash;but <i>you</i>&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, ma'am, there's a great deal of difference between I and you:
      only when one comes to bargaining&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, seeing wrath gathering black and dire in her young lady's
      countenance; before it burst, she changed her tone, and continued, "All I
      mean to say, ma'am, is, that white satin being a style of thing I could
      not pretend to think of wearing in any shape myself, I could only take it
      to part with again, and in the existing circumstances, I'm confident I
      should lose by it. But rather than disoblige, I'll take it at whatever you
      please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, I don't please about the matter, Lydia; but I am sure you had an
      excellent bargain of my lavender satin, which I had only worn but twice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear heart!&mdash;La, ma'am! if you knew what trouble I had with Mrs.
      Sparkes, the dress-maker, about it, because of the coffee-stain&mdash;And
      I vow to my stars I am ashamed to mention it; but Mrs. Scrags, Lady
      Trant's woman, and both the Lady Arlingtons' maids, can vouch for the
      truth of it. I did not make a penny, but lost, ma'am, last year, by you
      and Miss Bell; that is, not by you nor Miss Bell, but by all I bought, and
      sold to disadvantage; which, I am morally certain, you would not have
      permitted, had you known of it, as I told Mrs. Scrags, who was wondering
      and pitying of me: my young ladies, Mrs. Scrags, says I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter," interrupted Georgiana; "no matter what you said to Mrs.
      Scrags, or Mrs. Scrags to you&mdash;but tell me at once, Lydia, what you
      can afford to give me for these three gowns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I afford to give!" said Lydia Sharpe. "Well, the times is past, to be
      sure, and greatly changed, since ladies used to give, but now it's their
      maids must give&mdash;then, suppose&mdash;let's see, ma'am&mdash;for the
      three, the old white satin, and the amber satin, and the black lace&mdash;why,
      ma'am, if you'd throw me the pink crape into the bargain, I don't doubt
      but I could afford to give you nine guineas, ma'am," said the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, Lydia Sharpe, you will never have them, I promise you," cried the
      mistress: "Nine guineas! how can you have the assurance to offer me such a
      sum? As if I had never bought a gown in my life, and did not know the
      value or price of any thing! Do you take me for a fool?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! dear no, miss&mdash;I'm confident that you know the value and price
      to the uttermost penny&mdash;but only you forget that there's a difference
      betwixt the buying and selling price for ladies; but if you please, ma'am&mdash;I
      would do any thing to oblige and accommodate you&mdash;I will consult the
      Lady Arlingtons' women, Miss Flora, and Miss Prichard, who is judges in
      this line&mdash;most honourable appraisers; and if they praise the
      articles, on inspection, a shilling higher, I am sure I shall submit to
      their jurisdiction&mdash;if they say ten guineas, ma'am, you shall have
      it, for I love to be at a word and a blow&mdash;and to do every thing
      genteel: so I'll step and consult my friends, ma'am, and give you my
      ultimatum in half an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, whilst her young mistress stood flushed and swelling with pride
      and anger, which, however, the sense of her own convenience and interest
      controlled, the maid swept up the many coloured robes in her arms, and
      carried them up the back stairs, to hold her consultation with her
      friends, the most honourable of appraisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear," said Mrs. Falconer, returning as she heard the maid quit
      the room, "have you driven your bargain for the loan? Have you raised the
      supplies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed, ma'am&mdash;for Lydia is grown a perfect Jew. She may well
      say she is related to Sharpe, the attorney&mdash;she is the keenest, most
      interested creature in the world&mdash;and grown very saucy too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like all those people, my dear; but one can't do without them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But one can change them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, to use their own language, one is not sure of bettering oneself&mdash;and
      then their wages are to be paid&mdash;and all one's little family secrets
      are at their mercy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very provoking&mdash;it is very provoking!" repeated Miss Georgiana,
      walking up and down the room. "Such an extortioner!&mdash;for my amber
      satin, and my white satin, and my black lace, and my pink crape, only nine
      guineas! What do you think of that, ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think, my dear, you pay a prodigious premium for ready money; but nine
      guineas will dress Zara decently, I dare say, if that's your object."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nine guineas! ma'am," cried Miss Georgiana, "impossible! I can't act at
      all&mdash;so there's an end of the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not an end of the matter quite," said Mrs. Falconer, coolly; "for in that
      case I must look out for another Zara."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where will you find one, ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Lady Arlingtons have both fine figures&mdash;and, I dare say, would
      either of them oblige me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not they. Lady Anne, with her indolence and her languor&mdash;a lady who
      looks as if she was saying, 'Quasha, tell Quaco to tell Fibba to pick up
      this pin that lies at my foot;' do you think she'd get a part by heart,
      ma'am, to oblige you&mdash;or that she could, if she would, act Zara?&mdash;No
      more than she could fly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But her sister, Lady Frances, would and could," said Mrs. Falconer. "She
      is quick enough, and I know she longs to try Zara."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Longs!&mdash;Lord, ma'am, she longs for fifty things in a minute!&mdash;Quick!&mdash;Yes,
      but don't depend on her, I advise you; for she does not know, for two
      seconds together, what she would have or what she would do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I have resource in one who, I am persuaded, will not disappoint me
      or any body else," said Mrs. Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom can you mean, ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Caroline Percy. Count Altenberg put it into my head: he observed
      that she would look the character remarkably well&mdash;and I will write
      to her directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without power of articulating, Miss Georgiana Falconer fixed her eyes upon
      her mother for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think I have lost my senses this morning&mdash;I thought, and I am
      afraid so did many other people, that you had lost yours last night.
      Another such scene, your friends the Lady Arlingtons for spectators, you
      are ridiculous, and, of course, undone for life in the fashionable world&mdash;establishment,
      and every thing else that is desirable, irrevocably out of the question. I
      am surprised that a girl of your understanding and really polished
      manners, Georgiana, should, the moment any thing crosses or vexes you,
      show no more command of temper, grace, or dignity, than the veriest
      country girl. When things go wrong, do you see me lose all presence of
      mind; or rather, do you ever see me change a muscle of my countenance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The muscles of some people's countenance, ma'am, I suppose, are
      differently made from others&mdash;mine will change with my feelings, and
      there is no remedy, for my feelings unfortunately are uncommonly acute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a misfortune, indeed, Georgiana; but not without remedy, I trust.
      If you will take my advice&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you ever in love, ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Properly&mdash;when every thing was settled for my marriage; but not
      improperly, or it might never have come to my wedding-day. Headstrong
      child! listen to me, or you will never see that day with Count Altenberg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean, ma'am, to ask Miss Caroline Percy to play Zara?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will answer no question, Georgiana, till you have heard me patiently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only hope, ma'am, you'll put it in the play-bill&mdash;or, if you
      don't, I will&mdash;Zara, Miss Caroline Percy&mdash;by particular desire
      of Count Altenberg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever I do, you may hope and be assured, Georgiana, shall be properly
      done," cried Mrs. Falconer, rising with dignity; "and, since you are not
      disposed to listen to me, I shall leave you to your own inventions, and go
      and write my notes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "La, mamma! dear mamma! <i>dear'st</i> mamma!" cried the young lady,
      throwing her arms round her mother, and stopping her. "You that never
      change a muscle of your countenance, how hasty you are with your own
      Georgiana!&mdash;sit down, and I'll listen patiently!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer seated herself, and Miss Georgiana prepared to listen
      patiently, armed with a piece of gold fringe, which she rolled and
      unrolled, and held in different lights and varied festoons whilst her
      mother spoke, or, as the young lady would say, lectured. Mrs. Falconer was
      too well aware of the impracticableness of her daughter's temper to tell
      her upon this occasion the whole truth, even if her own habits would have
      permitted her to be sincere. She never mentioned to Georgiana that she had
      totally given up the scheme of marrying her to Count Altenberg, and that
      she was thoroughly convinced there was no chance of her winning him; but,
      on the contrary, she represented to the young lady that the Count had only
      a transient fancy for Miss Caroline Percy, which would never come to any
      serious proposal, unless it was opposed; that in a short time they should
      go to town, and the Count, of course, would return with Lord Oldborough:
      then the game would be in her own hands, provided, in the mean time,
      Georgiana should conduct herself with prudence and temper, and let no
      creature see or suspect any sort of anxiety; for that would give such an
      advantage against her, and such a triumph to Caroline and her friends,
      who, as Mrs. Falconer said, were, no doubt, all on the watch to
      "interpret," or misinterpret, "motions, looks, and eyes." "My dear,"
      concluded the mother, "your play is to show yourself always easy and
      happy, whatever occurs; occupied with other things, surrounded by other
      admirers, and encouraging them properly&mdash;properly of course to pique
      the jealousy of your Count."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Count!" said Georgiana, with half a smile; "but Miss&mdash;You say
      this fancy of his will pass away&mdash;but when? When?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You young people always say, '<i>but when?</i>' you have no idea of
      looking forward: a few months, a year, more or less, what does it signify?
      Georgiana, are you in such imminent danger of growing old or ugly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgiana turned her eyes involuntarily towards the glass, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, ma'am, you were not in earnest then about getting another Zara."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The offer I made&mdash;the compliments I paid in the note I wrote this
      morning, were all necessary to cover your mistakes of the night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Made! Wrote!" cried the young lady, with terror in her voice and eyes:
      "Good Heavens! mother, what have you done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had no doubt at the time I wrote," continued Mrs. Falconer, coolly, "I
      had no other idea, but that Miss Caroline Percy would decline."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! ma'am," cried Georgiana, half crying, then stamping with passion,
      "Oh! ma'am, how could you imagine, or affect to imagine, that that girl,
      that odious girl, who was born to be my plague, with all her affected
      humility, would decline?&mdash;Decline!&mdash;no, she will be transported
      to come sweeping in, in gorgeous tragedy&mdash;Zara! Marcia! If the whole
      family can beg or borrow a dress for her, we are undone&mdash;that's our
      only chance. Oh! mother, what possessed you to do this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gently, pretty Passionate, and trust to my judgment in future," putting
      into her daughter's hands Mrs. Percy's note.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Caroline Percy&mdash;sorry&mdash;out of her power!&mdash;Oh!
      charming!&mdash;a fine escape!" cried Georgiana, delighted. "You may be
      sure it was for want of the dress, though, mamma."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter&mdash;but about yours, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! yes, ma'am&mdash;my dress; that's the only difficulty now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly wish you, my darling, to appear well, especially as all the
      world will be here: the two Clays&mdash;by-the-bye, here's their letter&mdash;they
      come to-morrow&mdash;and in short the whole world; but, as to money,
      there's but one way of putting your father into good-humour enough with
      you to touch upon that string."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One way&mdash;well, if there be one way&mdash;any way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Petcalf!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Petcalf is my abhorrence&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is the thing! He was speaking to your father seriously about you,
      and your father sounded me: I said you would never agree, and he was quite
      displeased&mdash;that and Mrs. Sparkes' bill completely overset him. Now,
      if you had your wish, Georgiana&mdash;what would be your taste, child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wish! My taste!&mdash;Oh! that would be for a delicate, delicate,
      soft, sentimental blue satin, with silver fringe, looped with pearl, for
      my first act; and in my last&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two dresses! Oh! you extravagant! out of all possibility."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am only wishing, telling you my taste, dear mamma. You know there must
      be a change of dress, in the last act, for Zara's nuptials&mdash;now for
      my wedding dress, mamma, my taste would be
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Shine out, appear, be found, my lovely Zara,'
</pre>
    <p>
      in bridal white and silver. You know, ma'am, I am only supposing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then, supposition for supposition," replied Mrs. Falconer:
      "supposing I let your father hope that you are not <i>so</i> decided to
      abhor poor Petcalf&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! dear mamma, I am so persecuted about that Petcalf! and compared with
      Count Altenberg, my father must be blind, or think me an idiot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! between him and the Count there is no comparison, to be sure; but I
      forgot to mention, that what your father builds upon is our poor old
      friend the general's death&mdash;Clay here, in a postscript, you see,
      mentions the gout in his stomach&mdash;so I am afraid he is as good as
      gone, as your father says, and then <i>The Lodge</i> in <i>Asia Minor</i>
      is certainly a pretty place to sit down upon if one could do no better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, ma'am, the Count's vast possessions and rank!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I grant you all that, my dear; but our present object is the play&mdash;Zara's
      royal robes cannot be had for nothing, you know&mdash;you never listened
      to my infallible means of obtaining your wish: I think I can engage that
      the commissioner will not refuse us, if you will empower me to say to him,
      that by this time twelvemonth, if nothing better offers&mdash;mind my <i>if</i>&mdash;Petcalf
      shall be rewarded for his constancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If&mdash;Oh! dear me! But before this time twelvemonth the Count&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or one of the Clays might offer, and in that case, my <i>if</i> brings
      you off safe with your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, mamma, upon condition that you will promise me, upon your
      word, you will lay a marked emphasis upon your <i>if</i>&mdash;I believe,
      for Zara's sake, I must&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew you would behave at last like a sensible girl," said Mrs.
      Falconer: "I'll go and speak to your father directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer thus fairly gained her point, by setting Georgiana's passion
      for dress against her passion for Count Altenberg; and having, moreover,
      under false pretences, extorted from the young lady many promises to keep
      her temper prudently, and to be upon the best terms possible with her
      rival, the mother went away perfectly satisfied with her own address.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father was brought to perform his part, not without difficulty&mdash;Carte
      blanche for Zara's sentimental blue and bridal white robes was obtained,
      silver fringe and pearls inclusive: the triumphant Zara rang for the base
      confidante of her late distresses&mdash;Lydia Sharpe re-entered, with the
      four dresses upon sale; but she and her guineas, and the most honourable
      appraisers, all were treated with becoming scorn&mdash;and as Lydia obeyed
      her young lady's orders to replace her clothes in her wardrobe, and never
      to think of them more, they suddenly rose in value in her estimation, and
      she repented that she had been quite so much of an extortioner. She knew
      the difference of her mistress's tone when disappointed or successful, and
      guessed that supplies had been obtained by some means or other: "New
      dresses, I smell, are the order of the day," said Lydia Sharpe to herself;
      "but I'll engage she will want me presently to make them up: so I warrant
      I won't come down off my high horse till I see why&mdash;Miss Georgiana
      Falconer, ma'am, I beg pardon&mdash;you are the mistress&mdash;I meant
      only to oblige and accommodate when called upon&mdash;but if I'm not
      wanted, I'm not wanted&mdash;and I hope ladies will find them that will be
      more abler and willinger to serve them."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, half flouncing, half pouting, she retired. Her young mistress,
      aware that Lydia's talents and expeditious performance, as a mantua-maker
      and a milliner, were essential to the appearance of Zara, suppressed her
      own resentment, submitted to her maid's insolence, and brought her into
      humour again that night, by a present of the famous white satin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time, consequently, the Turkish dresses were in great forwardness.
      Lest we should never get to the play, we forbear to relate all the various
      frettings, jealousies, clashing vanities, and petty quarrels, which
      occurred between the actresses and their friends, during the getting up of
      this piece and its rehearsals. We need mention, only that the seeds of
      irreconcileable dislike were sown at this time, between the Miss Falconers
      and their dear friends, the Lady Arlingtons: there was some difficulty
      made by Lady Anne about lending her diamond crescent for Zara's turban&mdash;Miss
      Georgiana could never forgive this; and Lady Frances, on her part, was
      provoked, beyond measure, by an order from the duke, her uncle, forbidding
      her to appear on the stage. She had some reason to suspect that this order
      came in consequence of a treacherous hint in a letter of Georgiana's to
      Lady Trant, which went round, through Lady Jane Granville to the duke, who
      otherwise, as Lady Frances observed, "in the midst of his politics, might
      never have heard a word of the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer had need of all her power over the muscles of her face, and
      all her address, in these delicate and difficult circumstances. Her
      daughter Arabella, too, was sullen&mdash;the young lady was subject to her
      brother John's fits of obstinacy. For some time she could not be brought
      to undertake the part of Selima; and no other Selima was to be had. She
      did not see why she should condescend to play the confidante for
      Georgiana's Zara&mdash;why she was to be sacrificed to her sister; and Sir
      Robert Percy, her admirer, not even to be invited, because the other
      Percys were to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer plied her well with flattery, through Colonel Spandrill; and
      at last Arabella was pacified by a promise that the following week "Love
      in a Village," or "The Lord of the Manor," should be acted, in which she
      should choose her part, and in which her voice and musical talents would
      be brought forward&mdash;and Sir Robert Percy and his friends should be
      the principal auditors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovered, or partly recovered, from her fit of the sullens, she was
      prevailed upon to say she would try what she could do in Selima.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parts were learnt by heart; the dresses, after innumerable
      alterations, finished to the satisfaction of the heroes and heroines of
      the drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their quarrels, and the quarrels of their friends and of their servants,
      male and female, were at last hushed to temporary repose, and&mdash;the
      great, the important day arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preceding evening, Mrs. Falconer, as she sat quite exhausted in the
      green-room, was heard to declare, she was so tired, that she would not go
      through the same thing again, for one month, to be Queen of England.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The theatre at Falconer-court was not very spacious, but it was elegantly
      fitted up, extremely well lighted, and had a good effect. There was a
      brilliant audience, an excellent band of music, and the whole had a gay
      and festive appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Percy family, as they came from a great distance, were late. The house
      was crowded. Mrs. Falconer was obliged to seat Mrs. Percy and her
      daughters with the Lady Arlingtons on a bench upon the stage: a
      conspicuous situation, which had been reserved for their ladyships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every eye instantly turned upon the beautiful Caroline. She bore the gaze
      of public admiration with a blushing dignity, which interested every body
      in her favour. Count Altenberg, who had anxiously expected the moment of
      her arrival, was, however, upon his guard. Knowing that he was watched by
      Mrs. Falconer's friends, he was determined that his secret thoughts should
      not be seen. One involuntary glance he gave, but immediately withdrew his
      eye, and continued his conversation with the gentleman next to him. After
      a few moments had elapsed, he could indulge himself in looking at Caroline
      unobserved, for the gaze of public admiration is as transient as it is
      eager. It is surprising how short a time any face, however beautiful,
      engages numbers who meet together to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience were now happily full of themselves, arranging their seats,
      and doing civilities to those of their friends who were worthy of notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Trant! won't your ladyship sit in the front row?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm vastly well, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Kew, I am afraid you won't see over my head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I assure you&mdash;perfectly&mdash;perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Colonel Spandrill, I'll trouble you&mdash;my shawl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clay, lend me your opera-glass.&mdash;How did you leave all at Bath?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so glad that General Petcalf's gout in his stomach did not carry him
      off&mdash;for young Petcalf could not have acted, you know, to-night.&mdash;Mrs.
      Harcourt is trying to catch your eye, Lady Kew."
    </p>
    <p>
      All those who were new to the theatre at Falconer-court, or who were not
      intimate with the family, were in great anxiety to inform themselves on
      one important point, before the prologue should begin. Stretching to those
      who were, or had the reputation of being, good authorities, they asked in
      whispers, "Do you know if there is to be any clapping of hands?&mdash;Can
      you tell me whether it is allowable to say any thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that at some private theatres loud demonstrations of applause
      were forbidden. It was thought more genteel to approve and admire in
      silence,&mdash;thus to draw the line between professional actors and
      actresses, and gentlemen and lady performers. Upon trial, however, in some
      instances, it had been found that the difference was sufficiently obvious,
      without marking it by any invidious distinction. Young and old amateurs
      have acknowledged, that the silence, however genteel, was so dreadfully
      awful, that they preferred even the noise of vulgar acclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cup of flattery was found so sweet, that objections were no longer
      made to swallowing it in public.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overture finished, the prologue, which was written by Mr. Seebright,
      was received with merited applause. And, after a buzz of requests and
      promises for copies, the house was silent&mdash;the curtain drew up, and
      the first appearance of Zara, in the delicate sentimental blue satin, was
      hailed with plaudits, long and loud&mdash;plaudits which were reiterated
      at the end of her first speech, which was, indeed, extremely well recited.
      Count Altenberg leaned forward, and seemed to listen with delight; then
      stood up, and several times renewed his plaudits; at first, with an
      appearance of timidity, afterwards, with decision and energy. Miss
      Georgiana Falconer really acted uncommonly well, so that he could without
      flattery applaud; and if he did exaggerate a little in the expression of
      his admiration, he deemed it allowable. He had another object: he was
      absolutely determined to see whether or not Caroline was capable of the
      mean passions which had disgusted him in her rival. He reflected that he
      had seen her only when she was triumphant; and he was anxious to know how
      she would appear in different circumstances. Of her high intellectual
      endowments he could not doubt; but temper is not always a blessing given
      to the fair, or even to the wise. It may seem strange that a gallant man
      should think of a beauty's temper; and, probably, if Count Altenberg had
      considered Caroline only as a beauty, he would not have troubled himself
      to make, on this point, any severe and dangerous scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play went on&mdash;Zara sustaining the interest of the scene. She was
      but feebly supported by the sulky Selima, and the other parts were but ill
      performed. The faults common to unpractised actors occurred: one of
      Osman's arms never moved, and the other sawed the air perpetually, as if
      in pure despite of Hamlet's prohibition. Then, in crossing over, Osman was
      continually entangled in Zara's robe; or, when standing still, she was
      obliged to twitch her train thrice before she could get it from beneath
      his leaden feet. When confident that he could repeat a speech fluently, he
      was apt to turn his back upon his mistress; or, when he felt himself
      called upon to listen to his mistress, he would regularly turn his back
      upon the audience. But all these are defects permitted by the licence of a
      private theatre, allowable by courtesy to gentlemen-actors; and things
      went on as well as could be expected. Osman had not his part by heart, but
      still Zara covered all deficiencies: and Osman did no worse than other
      Osmans had done before him, till he came to the long speech, beginning
      with,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "The sultans, my great ancestors, bequeath'd
  Their empire to me, but their tastes they gave not."
</pre>
    <p>
      Powerful prompting got him through the first six lines decently enough,
      till he came to
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &mdash;"wasting tenderness in wild profusion,
  I might look down to my surrounded feet,
  And bless contending beauties,"
</pre>
    <p>
      At this he bungled sadly&mdash;his hearing suddenly failing as well as his
      memory, there was a dead stop. In vain the prompter, the scene-shifter,
      the candle-snuffer, as loud as they could, and much louder than they
      ought, reiterated the next sentence,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "I might speak,
  Serenely slothful."
</pre>
    <p>
      It was plain that Osman could not speak, nor was he "serene." He had
      begun, as in dangers great he was wont, to kick his left ankle-bone
      rapidly with his right heel; and through the pomp of Osman's oriental
      robes and turban young Petcalf stood confessed. He threw back an angry
      look at the prompter&mdash;Zara terrified, gave up all for lost&mdash;the
      two Lady Arlingtons retreated behind the scenes to laugh&mdash;the polite
      audience struggled not to smile. Count Altenberg at this moment looked at
      Caroline, who, instead of joining in the laugh, showed by her countenance
      and manner the most good-natured sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zara, recovering her presence of mind, swept across the stage in such a
      manner as to hide from view her kicking sultan; and as she passed, she
      whispered the line to him so distinctly, that he caught the sound, left
      off kicking, went on with his speech, and all was well again. Count
      Altenberg forgot to join in the cheering plaudits, he was so much charmed
      at that instant by Caroline's smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for Zara, and for the audience, in the next scenes the part of
      Lusignan was performed by a gentleman who had been well used to acting&mdash;though
      he was not a man of any extraordinary capacity, yet, from his <i>habit of
      the boards</i>, and his being perfect in his part, he now seemed quite a
      superior person. It was found unaccountably easier to act with this son of
      labour than with any other of the gentlemen-performers, though they were
      all natural geniuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment Zara appeared with Lusignan, her powers shone forth&mdash;nothing
      spoiled the illusion, the attention of the audience was fixed, their
      interest was sustained, their feelings touched. The exercise of the fan
      ceased in the front rows, glasses of lemonade were held untasted, and
      nobody consulted the play-bill. Excited by success, sympathy, and applause
      the most flattering, Zara went on with increasing éclat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Percy family, who were quite intent upon the play, began to
      find their situation disagreeable from some noise behind the scenes. A
      party of ladies, among whom was Lady Frances Arlington, stood whispering
      so loud close to Caroline that their voices were heard by her more
      distinctly than those of the actors. Lady Frances stood half hid between
      the side scenes, holding a little white dog in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" cried her ladyship, putting her fingers on her lips&mdash;her
      companions became silent instantly. The house was now in profound
      attention. Zara was in the midst of her favourite speech,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Would you learn more, and open all my heart?
  Know then that, spite of this renew'd injustice,
  I do not&mdash;cannot&mdash;wish to love you less;
  &mdash;That long before you look'd so low as Zara,
  She gave her heart to Osman."
</pre>
    <p>
      At the name of <i>Osman</i>, the dog started and struggled&mdash;Lady
      Frances appeared to restrain him, but he ran on the stage&mdash;leaped up
      on Zara&mdash;and at the repetition of the name of <i>Osman</i> sat down
      on his hind legs, begged with his fore-paws, and began to whine in such a
      piteous manner that the whole audience were on the brink of laughter&mdash;Zara,
      and all her attendants and friends, lost their presence of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline sprang forward quite across the stage, caught the dog in her
      arms, and carried him off. Count Altenberg, no longer master of himself,
      clapped his hands, and the whole house resounded with applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Georgiana Falconer misunderstood the cause of the plaudits, imagined
      that she was <i>encored</i>, cast down her eyes, and, as soon as there was
      silence, advanced and recommenced her speech, of which Count Altenberg did
      not hear one word.
    </p>
    <p>
      This malicious trick had been contrived by Lady Frances Arlington, to
      revenge herself on Miss Georgiana Falconer for having prevented her from
      taking a part in the play. Her ladyship had, in the course of the
      rehearsals, privately drilled her dog to answer to the name of Osman, when
      that name was pronounced in Zara's tragic tone. The dog had been kept out
      of the way till Zara was in the midst of that speech in which she calls
      repeatedly on the name of Osman. This trick had been so well contrived,
      that all but those who were in the secret imagined that the appearance of
      the dog at this unlucky moment had been accidental. The truth began indeed
      to be soon whispered in confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to Count Altenberg. At the commencement of the play, when
      the idea of trying Caroline's temper had occurred to him, he had felt some
      anxiety lest all the high expectations he had formed, all the bright
      enchantment, should vanish. In the first act, he had begun by joining
      timidly in the general applause of Zara, dreading lest Caroline should not
      be blessed with that temper which could bear the praises of a rival "with
      unwounded ear." But the count applauded with more confidence in the second
      act; during the third was quite at his ease; and in the fifth could not
      forgive himself for having supposed it possible that Caroline could be
      liable to any of the foibles of her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time Miss Georgiana Falconer, in high spirits, intoxicated
      with vanity, was persuaded that the Count had returned to his senses; and
      so little did she know of his character, or of the human heart, as to
      expect that a declaration of love would soon follow this public profession
      of admiration. Such was the confusion of her ideas, that she was confident
      Zara was on the point of becoming Countess of Altenberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the play was over, and a thousand compliments had been paid and
      received, most of the company called for their carriages. The house
      emptied fast: there remained only a select party, who were to stay supper.
      They soon adjourned to the green-room to repeat their tribute of applause
      to the actors. High in the midst stood Miss Georgiana Falconer, receiving
      incense from &amp; crowd of adorers. As Count Altenberg approached, she
      assumed a languishing air of softness and sensibility. The Count said all
      that could reasonably be expected, but his compliments did not seem quite
      to satisfy the lady. She was in hopes that he was going to say something
      more to her taste, when French Clay pressed forward, which he did with an
      air neither French nor English. He protested that he could not have
      conceived it possible for the powers of any actress upon earth to interest
      him for the English Zara; "but you, madam," said he, "have done the
      impossible; and now I should die content, if I could see your genius do
      justice to Zaïre. How you would shine in the divine original, when you
      could do such wonders for a miserable translation!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Several gentlemen, and among others Mr. Percy, would not allow that the
      English translation deserved to be called miserable. "The wrong side of
      the tapestry we cannot expect should be quite equal to the right side."
      said he: "Voltaire pointed out a few odds and ends here and there, which
      disfigured the work, and required to be cut off; but upon the whole, if I
      recollect, he was satisfied with the piece, and complimented Mr. Hill upon
      having preserved the general design, spirit, and simplicity of the
      original."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mere politeness in M. de Voltaire!" replied French Clay; "but, in effect,
      Zaïre is absolutely incapable of any thing more than being <i>done into</i>
      English. For example, will any body have the goodness to tell me," said
      he, looking round, and fixing his look of appeal on Miss Caroline Percy,
      "how would you translate the famous '<i>Zaïre!&mdash;vous pleurez!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is not it translated," said Caroline, "by 'Zara! you weep?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! <i>pardonnez moi!</i>" cried French Clay, with a shrug meant to be
      French, but which English shoulders could not cleverly execute&mdash;"<i>Ah!
      pardonnez!</i> to my ears now that says nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To our feelings it said a great deal just now," said Caroline, looking at
      Zara in a manner which was lost upon her feelings, but not upon Count
      Altenberg's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! indubitably I admit," cried Mr. Clay, "<i>la beauté est toujours dans
      son pays</i>, and tears fortunately need no translation; but when we come
      to words, you will allow me, ma'am, that the language of fine feeling is
      absolutely untranslateable, <i>untransfusible</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline seemed to wish to avoid being drawn forward to farther
      discussion, but Mr. Clay repeated, in a tone of soft condescension, "Your
      silence flatters me with the hope, ma'am, that we agree?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline could not submit to this interpretation of her silence, and
      blushing, but without being disconcerted, she answered, that she had
      always heard, and believed, it was the test of true feeling, as of true
      wit, that it can be easily understood, and that its language is universal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I had ever doubted that truth," said Count Altenberg, "I should have
      been convinced of it by what I have seen and heard this night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Georgiana Falconer bowed her head graciously to the Count, and
      smiled, and sighed. Lady Frances Arlington and Rosamond smiled at the same
      moment, for they perceived by the universal language of the eye, that what
      Count Altenberg said was not intended for the lady who took it so
      decidedly to herself. This was the second time this night that Miss
      Georgiana Falconer's vanity had appropriated to herself a compliment in
      which she had no share. Yet, even at this moment, which, as she conceived,
      was a moment of triumph, while she was encircled by adorers, while the
      voice of praise yet vibrated in her ears, she felt anguish at perceiving
      the serenity of her rival's countenance; and, however strange it may
      appear, actually envied Caroline for not being envious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer, skilled in every turn of her daughter's temper, which she
      was now obliged to follow and humour, or dexterously to counteract, lest
      it should ruin all schemes for her establishment, saw the cloud gathering
      on Zara's brow, and immediately fixed the attention of the company upon
      the beauty of her dress and the fine folds of her velvet train. She
      commenced lamentations on the difference between English and French
      velvets. French Clay, as she had foreseen, took up the word, and talked of
      <i>velvets</i> till supper was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Falconer attended Lady Trant and Lady Kew to their rooms, a
      nocturnal conference was held in Lady Trant's apartment, where, of course,
      in the most confidential manner, their ladyships sat talking over the
      events of the day, and of some matters too interesting to be spoken of in
      general society. They began to congratulate Mrs. Falconer upon the
      impression which Zara had made on Count Altenberg; but the wily mother
      repressed their premature felicitations. She protested she was positively
      certain that the person in question had <i>now</i> no thoughts of
      Georgiana, such as their ladyships' partiality to her might lead them to
      suppose; and now, when the business was over, she might venture to declare
      that nothing could have persuaded her to let a daughter of hers marry a
      foreigner. She should have been sorry to give offence to such an amiable
      and well-informed young nobleman; and she really rejoiced that, if her
      sentiments had been, as no doubt by a person of his penetration they must
      have been, discovered, Count Altenberg had taken the hint without being
      offended: indeed, she had felt it a point of conscience to let the truth
      be seen time enough, to prevent his coming to a downright proposal, and
      having the mortification of an absolute refusal. Other mothers, she knew,
      might feel differently about giving a daughter to a foreigner, and other
      young ladies might feel differently from her Georgiana. Where there was so
      great an establishment in prospect, and rank, and fashion, and figure, to
      say nothing of talents, it could hardly be expected that such temptations
      should be resisted in a <i>certain family</i>, where it was so very
      desirable, and indeed necessary, to get a daughter married without a
      portion. Mrs. Falconer declared that on every account she should rejoice,
      if things should happen to turn out so. The present object was every way
      worthy, and charming. She was a young lady for whom, even from the little
      she had seen of her, she confessed she felt uncommonly interested&mdash;putting
      relationship out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus having with able generalship secured a retreat for herself and for
      her daughter, Mrs. Falconer retired to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning one of Lord Oldborough's grooms brought a note for
      Mr. Percy. Commissioner Falconer's confidential servant took the note
      immediately up to his master's bedchamber, to inquire whether it would be
      proper to waken Mr. Percy to give it to him, or to make the groom wait
      till Mr. Percy should come down to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner sat up in his bed, rubbed his eyes, read the direction of
      the note, many times turned and returned it, and desired to see the man
      who brought it. The groom was shown in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is my lord's gout?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite well, sir: my lord was out yesterday in the park&mdash;both a
      horseback and afoot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very happy to hear it. And pray, did any despatches come last night
      from town, can you tell, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really can't particularly say, sir&mdash;I was out with the horses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But about this note?" said the commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of the cross-examination that followed gave reason to believe
      that the note contained an invitation to breakfast, because he had heard
      Mr. Rodney, my lord's own gentleman, tell the man whose business it was to
      attend at breakfast, that my lord would breakfast in his own room, and
      expected a friend to breakfast with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A friend&mdash;Hum! Was there no note to me?&mdash;no message?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None, sir&mdash;as I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very extraordinary." Mr. Falconer inclined to keep the man till
      breakfast-time, but he would not be kept&mdash;he had orders to return
      with an answer immediately; and he had been on the fidgets all the time
      the commissioner had been detaining him; for Lord Oldborough's messengers
      could nut venture to delay. The note was consequently delivered to Mr.
      Percy immediately, and Mr. Percy went to breakfast at Clermont-park. The
      commissioner's breakfast was spoiled by the curiosity this invitation
      excited, and he was obliged to chew green tea for the heartburn with great
      diligence. Meantime the company were all talking the play over and over
      again, till at last, when even Zara appeared satiated with the subject,
      the conversation diverged a little to other topics. Unluckily French Clay
      usurped so large a portion of attention, that Count Altenberg's voice was
      for some time scarcely heard&mdash;the contrast was striking between a
      really well-bred polished foreigner, and a man who, having kept bad
      company abroad, and having formed himself on a few bad models, presented
      an exaggerated imitation of those who were ridiculous, detested, or
      unknown, in good society at Paris; and whom the nation would utterly
      disclaim as representatives of their morals or manners. At this period of
      their acquaintance with Count Altenberg, every circumstance which drew out
      his character, tastes, and opinions, was interesting to the Percy family
      in general, and in particular to Caroline. The most commonplace and
      disagreeable characters often promoted this purpose, and thus afforded
      means of amusement, and materials for reflection. Towards the end of
      breakfast, the newspapers were brought in&mdash;the commissioner, who had
      wondered frequently what could make them so late, seized upon the
      government-paper directly, which he pocketed, and retired, after handing
      other newspapers to Count Altenberg and to the Mr. Clays. English Clay,
      setting down his well-sugared cup of tea, leaving a happily-prepared
      morsel of ham and bread and butter on his plate, turned his back upon the
      ladies; and comfortably settling himself with his arm over his chair, and
      the light full upon London news, began to read to himself. Count Altenberg
      glanced at <i>Continental News</i>, as he unfolded his paper, but
      instantly turned to <i>Gazette Extraordinary</i>, which he laid before
      Mrs. Falconer. She requested him, if it was not too much trouble, to read
      it aloud. "I hope my foreign accent will not make it unintelligible," said
      he; and without farther preface, or considering how he was to appear
      himself, he obeyed. Though he had not a perfectly English accent, he
      showed that he had a thoroughly English heart, by the joy and pride he
      took in reading an account of a great victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      English Clay turned round upon his chair, and setting his arms a-kimbo,
      with the newspaper still fast in his hand, and his elbow sticking out
      across Lady Anne Arlington, sat facing the count, and listening to him
      With a look of surprise. "Why, d&mdash;&mdash;m'me, but you're a good
      fellow, after all!" exclaimed he, "though you are not an Englishman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the mother's side I am, sir," replied Count Altenberg. "I may boast
      that I am at least half an Englishman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Half is better than the whole," said French Clay, scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the Lord, I could have sworn his mother, or some of his blood, was
      English!" cried English Clay. "I beg your pardon, ma'am&mdash;'fraid I
      annoy your ladyship?" added he, perceiving that the Lady Anne haughtily
      retreated from his offending elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then sensible of having committed himself by his sudden burst of feeling,
      he coloured all over, took up his tea, drank as if he wished to hide his
      face for ever in the cup, recovered his head with mighty effort, turned
      round again to his newspaper, and was cold and silent as before. His
      brother meanwhile was, or affected to be, more intent upon some <i>eau
      sucrée</i>, that he was preparing for himself, than upon the fate of the
      army and navy of Spain or England. Rising from the breakfast table, he
      went into the adjoining room, and threw himself at full length upon a
      sofa; Lady Frances Arlington, who detested politics, immediately followed,
      and led the way to a work-table, round which the ladies gathered, and
      formed themselves in a few minutes into a committee of dress, all speaking
      at once; Count Altenberg went with the ladies out of the breakfast-room,
      where English Clay would have been happy to have remained alone; but being
      interrupted by the entrance of the servants, he could not enjoy peaceable
      possession, and he was compelled also to follow:&mdash;getting as far as
      he could from the female committee, he took Petcalf into a window to talk
      of horses, and commenced a history of the colts of Regulus, and of the
      plates they had won.
    </p>
    <p>
      French Clay, rising from the sofa, and adjusting his cravat at a
      looking-glass, carelessly said, addressing himself to Count Altenberg, "I
      think, M. le Comte, I heard you say something about public feelings. Now,
      I do not comprehend precisely what is meant by public feelings; for my
      part, I am free to confess that I have none."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly must have expressed myself ill," replied Count Altenberg; "I
      should have said, love of our country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Percy, Rosamond, and Caroline, escaped from the committee of dress,
      were now eagerly listening to this conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if you had, M. le Comte, I might, <i>en philosophe</i>, have been
      permitted to ask," replied French Clay, "what is love of our country, but
      a mere <i>prejudice</i>? and to a person of an <i>emancipated</i> mind,
      that word prejudice says volumes. Assuredly M. le Comte will allow, and
      must <i>feel well</i>, that no prejudice ever was or can be useful to
      mankind."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count fully admitted that utility is the best human test by which all
      sentiment, as well as every thing else, can be tried: but he observed that
      Mr. Clay had not yet proved love of our country to be a useless or
      pernicious principle of action: and by his own argument, if it can be
      proved to be useful, it should not be called, in the invidious sense of
      the word, a prejudice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True&mdash;but the labour of the proof fortunately rests with you, M. le
      Comte."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg answered in French, speaking very rapidly. "It is a labour
      saved me fortunately, by the recorded experience of all history, by the
      testimony of the wisest and the best in all, countries, ancient and modern&mdash;all
      agree in proclaiming love of our country to be one of the most powerful,
      most permanent motives to good and great actions; the most expansive,
      elevating principle&mdash;elevating without danger&mdash;expansive without
      waste; the principle to which the legislator looks for the preservative
      against corruption in states&mdash;to which the moralist turns for the
      antidote against selfishness in individuals. Recollect, name any great
      character, ancient or modern&mdash;is not love of his country one of his
      virtues? Can you draw&mdash;can you conceive a great character&mdash;a
      great or a good character, or even a safe member of society without it? A
      man hangs loose upon society, as your own Burke says&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! M. le Comte!" cried Clay, shrinking with affected horror, "I repent&mdash;I
      see what I have brought upon myself; after Burke will come Cicero; and
      after Cicero all Rome, Carthage, Athens, Lacedemon. Oh! spare me! since I
      was a schoolboy, I could never <i>suffer</i> those names. Ah! M. le Comte,
      de grâce!&mdash;I know I have put myself <i>in the case</i> to be buried
      alive under a load of quotations."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count, with that good humour which disappoints ridicule, smiled, and
      checked his enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there not a kind of enthusiasm," said Mrs. Percy, "which is as
      necessary to virtue as to genius?"
    </p>
    <p>
      French Clay shook his head. He was sorry to differ from a lady; as a
      gallant man, he knew he was wrong, but as a philosopher he could not
      patronize enthusiasm. It was the business, he apprehended, of philosophy
      to correct and extinguish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard it said," interposed Rosamond, "that it is a favourite maxim
      of law, that the extreme of justice is the extreme of injustice&mdash;perhaps
      this maxim may be applied to philosophy as well as to law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why extinguish enthusiasm?" cried Caroline. "It is not surely the
      business of philosophy to extinguish, but to direct it. Does not
      enthusiasm, well directed, give life and energy to all that is good and
      great?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was so much life and energy in Caroline's beautiful countenance,
      that French Clay was for a moment silenced by admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," resumed he, "there is one slight circumstance, which persons
      of feeling should consider, that the evils and horrors of war are produced
      by this very principle, which some people think so useful to mankind, this
      famous love of our country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg asked, whether wars had not more frequently arisen from
      the unlawful fancies which princes and conquerors are apt to take for the
      territories of their neighbours, than from the legitimate love of their
      own country?
    </p>
    <p>
      French Clay, hurried by a smile he saw on Rosamond's lips, changed his
      ground again for the worse, and said he was not speaking of wars, of
      foreign conquests, but of defensive wars, where foolish people, from an
      absurd love of their own country, that is, of certain barren mountains, of
      <i>a few acres of snow</i>, or of collections of old houses and churches,
      called capital cities, will expose themselves to fire, flame, and famine,
      and will stand to be cut to pieces inchmeal, rather than to submit to a
      conqueror, who might, ten to one, be a more civilized or cleverer sort of
      a person than their own rulers; and under whom they might enjoy all the
      luxuries of life&mdash;changing only the name of their country for some
      other equally well-sounding name; and perhaps adopting a few new laws,
      instead of what they might have been in the habit from their childhood of
      worshipping, as a wittenagemote, or a diet, or a constitution. "For my
      part," continued French Clay, "I have accustomed myself to go to the
      bottom of things. I have <i>approfondied</i>. I have not suffered my
      understanding to be paralysed&mdash;I have made my own analysis of
      happiness, and find that your legislators, and moralists, and patriots,
      would juggle me out of many solid physical comforts, by engaging me to
      fight for enthusiasms which do me no manner of good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg's countenance had flushed with indignation, and cooled
      with contempt, several times during Mr. Clay's Speech. Beginning in a low
      composed voice, he first answered, whatever pretence to reason it
      contained, in the analysis of human happiness, he observed, Mr. Clay had
      bounded his to physical comforts&mdash;this was reducing civilized man
      below even the savage, and nearly to the state of brutes. Did Mr. Clay
      choose to leave out all intellectual pleasures&mdash;all the pleasures of
      self-complacency, self-approbation, and sympathy? But, supposing that he
      was content to bound his happiness, inelegant and low, to such narrow
      limits, Count Altenberg observed, he did not provide for the security even
      of that poor portion. If he were ready to give up the liberty or the free
      constitution of the country in which he resided, ready to live under
      tyrants and tyranny, how could he be secure for a year, a day, even an
      hour, of his epicurean paradise?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clay acknowledged, that, "in this point of view, it might be awkward
      to live in a conquered country; but if a man has talents to make himself
      agreeable to the powers that be, and money in his purse, <i>that</i> can
      never touch him, <i>chacun pour soi&mdash;et honi soit qui mal y pense</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it in England!&mdash;Oh! can it be in England, and from an Englishman,
      that I hear such sentiments!" exclaimed Count Altenberg. "Such I have
      heard on the continent&mdash;such we have heard the precursors of the
      ruin, disgrace, destruction of the princes and nations of Europe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Some painful reflections or recollections seemed to absorb the Count for a
      few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Foi d'honnête homme et de philosophe</i>," French Clay declared, that,
      for his own part, he cared not who ruled or how, who was conqueror, or
      what was conquered, provided champagne and burgundy were left to him by
      the conqueror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond thought it was a pity Mr. Clay was not married to the lady who
      said she did not care what revolutions happened, as long as she had her
      roast chicken, and her little game at cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happen what will," continued French Clay, "I have two hundred thousand
      pounds, well counted&mdash;as to the rest, it is quite indifferent to me,
      whether England be called England or France; for," concluded he, walking
      off to the committee of dress, "after all I have heard, I recur to my
      first question, what is country&mdash;or, as people term it, <i>their
      native land</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The following lines came full into Caroline's recollection as French Clay
      spoke:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Breathes there the man with soul so dead,
  Who never to himself has said,
  This is my own, my native land?
  Whose heart has ne'er within him burn'd,
  As home his footsteps he hath turn'd,
  From wandering on a foreign strand?
  If such there he, go, mark him well;
  High though his titles, proud his fame,
  Boundless his wealth, as wish can claim,
  Despite these titles, power and pelf,
  The wretch, concentred all in self,
  Living shall forfeit fair renown,
  And doubly dying shall go down
  To the vile dust from whence he sprung.
  Unwept, unhonour'd, and unsung."
</pre>
    <p>
      Caroline asked Count Altenberg, who seemed well acquainted with English
      literature, if he had ever read Scott's Lay of the Last Minstrel?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count smiled, and replied,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "'Breathes there the man with soul so dead,
  Who never to himself has said'
</pre>
    <p>
      any of those beautiful lines?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline, surprised that the Count knew so well what had passed in her
      mind, blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Mrs. Falconer returned, and throwing a reconnoitring glance
      round the room to see how the company had disposed of themselves, was well
      pleased to observe French Clay leaning on the back of Georgiana's chair,
      and giving her his opinion about some artificial flowers. The ladies had
      been consulting upon the manner in which the characters in "Love in a
      Village,"&mdash;or, "The Lord of the Manor," should be dressed, and Miss
      Arabella Falconer had not yet completely determined which piece or which
      dress she preferred. She was glad that the Percys had been kept from this
      committee, because, as they were not to be asked to the entertainment, it
      was a subject she could not discuss before them. Whenever they had
      approached the table, the young ladies had talked only of fashions in
      general; and now, as Mrs. Percy and Caroline, followed by Count Altenberg,
      joined them, Mrs. Falconer put aside a volume of plays, containing "The
      Lord of the Manor," &amp;c.; and, taking up another book, said something
      about the immortal bard to English Clay, who happened to be near her. He
      replied, "I have every edition of Shakspeare that ever was printed or
      published, and every thing that ever was written about him, good, bad, or
      indifferent, at Clay-hall. I made this a principle, and I think every
      Englishman should do the same. <i>Your</i> Mr. Voltaire," added this
      polite Englishman, turning to Count Altenberg, "made a fine example of
      himself by <i>dashing</i> at <i>our</i> Shakspeare?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly, Voltaire showed he did not understand Shakspeare, and
      therefore did not do him justice," replied Count Altenberg. "Even Voltaire
      had some tinge of national prejudice, as well as other men. It was
      reserved for women to set us, in this instance, as in many others, an
      example at once of superior candour and superior talent."
    </p>
    <p>
      English Clay pulled up his boots, and, with a look of cool contempt, said,
      "I see you are a lady's man, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg replied, that if a lady's man means an admirer of the fair
      sex, he was proud to feel that he deserved that compliment; and with much
      warmth he pronounced such a panegyric upon that sex, without whom "<i>le
      commencement de la vie est sans secours, le milieu sans plaisir, et la fin
      sans consolation</i>," that even Lady Anne Arlington raised her head from
      the hand on which it reclined, and every female eye turned upon him with
      approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! what a lover he will make, if ever he is in love," cried Lady Frances
      Arlington, who never scrupled saying any thing that came into her head. "I
      beg pardon, I believe I have said something very shocking. Georgiana, my
      dear, I protest I was not thinking of&mdash;But what a disturbance I have
      made amongst all your faces, ladies&mdash;and <i>gentlemen</i>," repeated
      her ladyship, looking archly at the Count, whose face at this moment
      glowed manifestly; "and all because gentlemen and ladies don't mind their
      grammar and their tenses. Now don't you recollect&mdash;I call upon Mrs.
      Falconer, who really has some presence of&mdash;countenance&mdash;I call
      upon Mrs. Falconer to witness that I said 'if;' and, pray comprehend me,
      M. le Comte, else I must appear excessively rude, I did not mean to say
      any thing of the present or the past, but only of the future."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count, recovering his presence of mind, and <i>presence</i> of <i>countenance</i>,
      turned to a little Cupid on the mantel-piece; and, playfully doing homage
      before it, repeated,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Qui que tu sois voici ton maître,
  Il l'est, le fut&mdash;ou le doit être."
</pre>
    <p>
      "Oh! charming&mdash;oh! for a translation!" cried Mrs. Falconer, glad to
      turn the attention from Georgiana:&mdash;"Lady Frances&mdash;ladies some
      of you, Miss Percy, here's my pencil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they were interrupted by Mr. Percy's return from Lord Oldborough's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner followed Mr. Percy into the room, and asked, and was
      answered, a variety of questions about despatches from town; trying, but,
      in vain, to find out what had been going forward. At last he ended with a
      look of absence, and a declaration that he was quite happy to hear that
      Lord Oldborough had <i>so</i> completely got rid of his gout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Completely," said Mr. Percy; "and he desires me to tell you, that it will
      be necessary for him to return to town in a few days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a few days!" cried the commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a few days!" repeated several voices, in different tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a few days!&mdash;Gracious Heaven! and what will become of 'the Lord
      of the Manor!'" cried Miss Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gently, my Arabella! never raise your voice so high&mdash;you, who are a
      musician," said Mrs. Falconer, "and so sweet a voice as you have&mdash;in
      general. Besides," added she, drawing her apart, "you forget that you
      should not speak of 'the Lord of the Manor' before the Percys, as they are
      not to be asked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure. Pray keep your temper, Bell, if you can, for a minute,"
      whispered Miss Georgiana; "you see they have rung for the carriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer began to entreat Mrs. Percy would not be in a hurry to run
      away; but to her great joy the carriage came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      At parting with Count Altenberg, Mr. Percy said that he regretted that
      they were so soon to lose his company in this part of the world. "We, who
      live so much retired, shall feel the loss particularly."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count, evidently agitated, only said, in a low voice, "We are not
      parting yet&mdash;we shall meet again&mdash;I hope&mdash;do you ever go to
      London?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events, we <i>must</i> meet again," said the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies had all collected at the open windows, to see the departure of
      the Percys; but Miss Georgiana Falconer could learn nothing from the
      manner in which the Count handed Caroline into the carriage. It did not
      appear even that he spoke to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return, the Miss Falconers, and the Lady Arlingtons, were of course
      talking of those who had just left the house. There was at first but one
      voice in praise of Caroline's beauty and talents, elegance, and simplicity
      of manner. Mrs. Falconer set the example; Lady Frances Arlington and Miss
      Georgiana Falconer extolled her in the highest terms&mdash;one to provoke,
      the other not to appear provoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "La!" said Lady Frances, "how we may mistake even the people we know best&mdash;Georgiana,
      can you conceive it? I never should have guessed, if you had not told me,
      that Miss Caroline Percy was such a favourite of yours. Do you know now,
      so little penetration have I, I should have thought that you rather
      disliked her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite right, my dear Lady Frances," cried Mrs. Falconer; "I give
      you credit for your penetration: <i>entre nous</i>, Miss Caroline Percy is
      no favourite of Georgiana."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgiana actually opened her eyes with astonishment, and thought her
      mother did not know what she was saying, and that she certainly did not
      perceive that Count Altenberg was in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Count Altenberg, is this the book you are looking for?" said the young
      lady, pronouncing Count Altenberg's name very distinctly, to put her
      mother on her guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer continued precisely in the same tone. "Georgiana does
      justice, I am sure, to Miss Percy's merit and charms; but the truth is,
      she does not like her, and Georgiana has too much frankness to conceal it;
      and now come here, and I will tell you the reason." In a half whisper, but
      perfectly intelligible to every one in the room, Mrs. Falconer went on&mdash;"Georgiana's
      favourite brother, Buckhurst&mdash;did you never hear it? In days of yore,
      there was an attachment&mdash;Buckhurst, you know, is very ardent in his
      attachments&mdash;desperately in love he was&mdash;and no wonder. But at
      that time he was nobody&mdash;he was unprovided for, and the young lady
      had a good fortune then&mdash;her father would have him go to the bar&mdash;against
      the commissioner's wishes. You know a young man will do any thing if he is
      in love, and is encouraged&mdash;I don't know how the thing went on, or
      off, but Buckhurst found himself disappointed at last, and was so
      miserable about it! ready to break his heart! you would have pitied him!
      Georgiana was so sorry for him, that she never could forgive the young
      lady&mdash;though I really don't imagine, after all, she was to blame. But
      sisters will feel for their brothers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgiana, charmed to find this amiable mode of accounting for her dislike
      to Caroline, instantly pursued her mother's hint, and frankly declared
      that she never could conceal either her likings or dislikings&mdash;that
      Miss Caroline Percy might have all the merit upon earth, and she did not
      doubt but she had; yet she never could forgive her for jilting Buckhurst&mdash;no,
      never! never! It might be unjust, but she owned that it was a
      prepossession she could not conquer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, indeed, my dear young lady, I hardly know how to blame you," cried
      Lady Trant; "for certainly a jilt is not a very amiable character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! my dear Lady Trant, don't use such a word&mdash;Georgiana!&mdash;Why
      will you be so warm, so very unguarded, where that darling brother is
      concerned? You really&mdash;Oh! my dear Lady Trant, this must not go
      farther&mdash;and positively the word jilt must never be used again; for
      I'm confident it is quite inapplicable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd not swear for that," cried Lady Trant; "for, now I recollect, at Lady
      Angelica Headingham's, what was it we heard, my dear Lady Kew, about her
      coquetting with that Mr. Barclay, who is now going to be married to Lady
      Mary Pembroke, you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! yes, I did hear something, I recollect&mdash;but, at the time, I
      never minded, because I did not know, then, who that Miss Caroline Percy
      was&mdash;true, true, I recollect it now. And all, you know, we heard
      about her and Sir James Harcourt&mdash;was there not something there? By
      all accounts, it is plain she is not the simple country beauty she looks&mdash;practised!&mdash;practised!
      you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Georgiana Falconer's only fear was, that Count Altenberg might not
      hear Lady Kew, who had lowered her voice to the note of mystery. Mrs.
      Falconer, who had accomplished her own judicious purpose, of accounting
      for Georgiana's dislike of Miss Caroline Percy, was now afraid that her
      dear friends would overdo the business; she made many efforts to stop
      them, but once upon the scent of scandal, it was no easy matter to change
      the pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to have found something that has caught your attention
      delightfully, Count Altenberg," said Mrs. Falconer; "how I envy any one
      who is completely <i>in</i> a book&mdash;what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Johnson's preface to Shakspeare."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Georgiana Falconer was vexed, for she recollected that Miss Caroline
      Percy had just been speaking of it with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer wondered how it could have happened that she had never read
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Kew persevered in her story. "Sir James Harcourt, I know, who is the
      most polite creature in the whole world, and who never speaks an ill word
      of any body, I assure you, said of Miss Caroline Percy in my hearing&mdash;what
      I shall not repeat. Only this much I must tell you, Mrs. Falconer&mdash;Mrs.
      Falconer!&mdash;She won't listen because the young lady is a relation of
      her own&mdash;and we are very rude; but truth is truth, notwithstanding,
      you know. Well, well, she may talk of Miss Percy's beauty and abilities&mdash;very
      clever she is, I don't dispute; but this I may say, that Mrs. Falconer
      must never praise her to me for simplicity of character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no," said Miss Georgiana; "one is apt to suppose that a person who
      has lived all her life in the country must, of course, have great
      simplicity. But there is a simplicity of character, and a simplicity of
      manner, and they don't always go together. Caroline Percy's manner is
      fascinating, because, you know, it is what one does not meet with every
      day in town&mdash;that was what struck my poor brother&mdash;that and her
      great talents, which can make her whatever she pleases to be: but I am
      greatly afraid she is not quite the <i>ingenuous</i> person she looks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg changed colour, and was putting down his book suddenly,
      when Mrs. Falconer caught it, and stopping him, asked how far he had read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he was turning over the leaves, Lady Trant went on, in her turn&mdash;"With
      all her <i>practice</i>, or her <i>simplicity</i>, whichever it may be&mdash;far
      be it from me to decide which&mdash;I fancy she has met with her match,
      and has been disappointed in her turn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really!" cried Georgiana, eagerly: "How! What! When!&mdash;Are you
      certain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last summer&mdash;Oh! I have it from those who know the gentleman well.
      Only an affair of the heart that did not end happily: but I am told she
      was very much in love. The family would not hear of it&mdash;the mother,
      especially, was averse: so the young gentleman ended by marrying&mdash;exceedingly
      well&mdash;and the young lady by wearing the willow, you know, a decent
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! why did you never tell me this before?" said Miss Georgiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I protest I never thought of it, till Lady Kew brought it to my
      recollection, by talking of Lady Angelica Headingham, and Sir James
      Harcourt, and all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who was the gentleman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a secret," replied Lady Trant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A secret!&mdash;A secret!&mdash;What is it? What is it?" cried Lady
      Frances Arlington, pressing into the midst of the party; for she was the
      most curious person imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then heads joined, and Lady Trant whispered, and Lady Frances exclaimed
      aloud, "Hungerford?&mdash;Colonel Hungerford!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fie! fie! Lady Frances," cried Georgiana&mdash;and "Fie! fie! you are a
      pretty person to keep a secret," cried Lady Trant: "I vow I'll never trust
      your ladyship with a secret again&mdash;when you publish it in this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I vow you will," said Lady Frances. "Why, you all know, in your hearts,
      you wish to publish it&mdash;else why tell it&mdash;especially to me? But
      all this time I am not thinking in the least about the matter, nor was I
      when I said <i>Hungerford</i>&mdash;I was and am thinking of my own
      affairs. What did I do with the letter I received this morning? I had it
      here&mdash;no, I hadn't it&mdash;yes, I had&mdash;Anne!&mdash;Anne!&mdash;Lady
      Anne! the duchess's letter: I gave it to you; what did you do with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "La! it is somewhere, I suppose," said Lady Anne, raising her head, and
      giving a vague look round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Frances made every one search their work-boxes, writing-boxes, and
      reticules; then went from table to table, opening and shutting all the
      drawers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frances!&mdash;If you would not fly about so! What can it signify?"
      expostulated Lady Anne. But in vain; her sister went on, moving every
      thing and every body in the room, displacing all the cushions of all the
      chairs in her progress, and, at last, approached Lady Anne's sofa, with
      intent to invade her repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Frances!" cried Lady Anne, in a deprecating tone, with a gesture of
      supplication and anguish in her eyes, "do let me rest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, till I have the letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      With the energy of anger and despair Lady Anne made an effort to reach the
      bell-cord&mdash;but it missed&mdash;the cord swung&mdash;Petcalf ran to
      catch it, and stumbled over a stool&mdash;English Clay stood still and
      laughed&mdash;French Clay exclaimed, "<i>Ah! mon Dieu! Cupidon!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg saved Cupid from falling, and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said Lady Anne to the footman, "I had a letter&mdash;some time this
      morning, in my hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray, sir, tell somebody to tell Pritchard, to tell Flora, to go up
      stairs to my dressing-room, sir, to look every where for't; and let it be
      brought to my sister, Lady Frances, if you please, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, sir, don't do any thing about the matter, if you please&mdash;I
      will go myself," said Lady Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away the lady ran up stairs, and down again, with the letter in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! exactly as I thought," cried she; "my aunt does say, that Mrs.
      Hungerford is to be down to-day&mdash;I thought so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely," said Lady Anne; "I never thought about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Anne, you must think about it, for my aunt desires we should go and
      see her directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't go," said Lady Anne&mdash;"I've a cold&mdash;your going will do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Falconer, my dear Mrs. Falconer, will you go with me to-morrow to
      Hungerford Castle?" cried Lady Frances, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible! my dear Lady Frances, unfortunately quite impossible. The
      Hungerfords and we have no connexion&mdash;there was an old family quarrel&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! never mind family quarrels and connexions&mdash;you can go, and I am
      sure it will be taken very well&mdash;and you know you only go with me.
      Oh! positively you must&mdash;now there's my good dear Mrs. Falconer&mdash;yes,
      and order the carriage this minute for to-morrow early," said Lady
      Frances, in a coaxing yet impatient tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer adhered to its being absolutely impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, Anne, you must go."
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;Anne was impenetrable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll go by myself," cried Lady Frances, pettishly&mdash;"I'll take
      Pritchard with me, in our own carriage, and I'll speak about it directly&mdash;for
      go I must and will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Frances, what new fancy is this for Mrs. Hungerford? I am sure you
      used not to care about her," said Lady Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I dare say I should not care about her now," replied Lady Frances,
      "but that I am dying to see an old pair of shoes she has."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An old pair of shoes!" repeated Lady Anne, with a look of unutterable
      disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An old pair of shoes!" cried Mrs. Falconer, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a pair of blue damask shoes as old as Edward the Fourth's time&mdash;with
      chains from the toe to the knee, you know&mdash;or do you know, Count
      Altenberg? Miss Percy was describing them&mdash;she saw Colonel Hungerford
      put them on&mdash;Oh! he must put them on for me&mdash;I'll make him put
      them on, chains and all, to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Colonel Hungerford is on his way to India by this time," said Georgiana
      Falconer, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask," said Count Altenberg, taking advantage of the first pause in
      the conversation&mdash;"may I ask if I understood rightly, that Mrs.
      Hungerford, mother of Colonel Hungerford, lives in this neighbourhood, and
      is coming into the country to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;just so," said Lady Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      What concern can it be of his? thought Miss Georgiana Falconer, fixing her
      eyes upon the Count with alarmed curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew Colonel Hungerford abroad," continued the Count, "and have a great
      regard for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Kew, Lady Trant, and Miss Georgiana Falconer, exchanged looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry that he is gone to India," said Mrs. Falconer, in a
      sentimental tone; "it would have been so pleasant to you to have renewed
      an acquaintance with him in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg regretted the absence of his friend, the colonel; but,
      turning to Lady Frances, he congratulated himself upon having an
      opportunity of presenting his letters of introduction, and paying his
      respects to Mrs. Hungerford, of whom he had heard much from foreigners who
      had visited England, and who had been charmed with her, and with her
      daughter, Mrs. Mortimer&mdash;his letters of introduction had been
      addressed to her town residence, but she was not in London when he was
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, she was at Pembroke," said Lady Kew.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm sure I wish she were there still, thought Miss Georgiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, after all, Lady Frances, is the duchess sure that Mrs. Hungerford is
      actually come to the country?&mdash;May be, she is still in town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have the honour of letting your ladyship know; for, if Lord
      Oldborough will permit, I shall certainly go, very soon, to pay my
      respects at Hungerford Castle," said Count Altenberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prescient jealousy of Miss Georgiana Falconer boded ill of this visit
      to Hungerford Castle. A few days afterwards a note was received from Count
      Altenberg, returning many thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Falconer for the
      civilities he had received from them, paying all proper compliments to
      Zara, announcing his intention of accepting an invitation to stay some
      time at Mrs. Hungerford's, and taking a polite leave of the Falconer
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a death-blow to all Georgiana's hopes! But we shall not stay to
      describe her disappointment, or the art of her mother in concealing it;
      nor shall we accompany Mrs. Falconer to town, to see how her designs upon
      the Clays or Petcalf prospered. We must follow Count Altenberg to
      Hungerford Castle.

      CHAPTER XXIX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Who would prize the tainted posies,
    Which on ev'ry breast are worn?
  Who could pluck the spotless roses
    From their never touched thorn?"
</pre>
    <p>
      The feeling expressed in these lines will be acknowledged by every man of
      sense and delicacy. "No such man ever prized a heart much hackneyed in the
      ways of love." It was with exquisite pain that Count Altenberg had heard
      all that had been said of Caroline&mdash;he did not give credit to half
      the insinuations&mdash;he despised those who made them: he knew that some
      of the ladies spoke from envy, others from the mere love of scandal; but
      still, altogether, an impression unfavourable to Caroline, or rather
      unfavourable to his passion for Caroline, was left on his mind. The idea
      that she had been suspected, the certainty that she had been talked of,
      that she had even been named as one who had coquetted with many admirers&mdash;the
      notion that she had been in love&mdash;passionately in love&mdash;all this
      took from the freshness, the virgin modesty, the dignity, the charm, with
      which she had appeared to his imagination, and without which she could not
      have touched his heart&mdash;a heart not to be easily won.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his own country, at the court where he resided, in the different parts
      of the continent which he had visited, Germany, Poland, Switzerland,
      France, he had seen women celebrated for beauty and for wit, many of the
      most polished manners, many of the highest accomplishments, some of
      exquisite sensibility, a few with genuine simplicity of character, but in
      all there had been something which had prevented his wishing to make any
      one of them the companion of his life. In some there was a want of good
      temper&mdash;in others of good sense; there was some false taste for
      admiration or for notoriety&mdash;some love of pleasure, or some love of
      sway, inconsistent with his idea of the perfection of the female
      character, incompatible with his plans of life, and with his notions of
      love and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In England, where education, institutions, opinion, manners, the habits of
      society, and of domestic life, happily combine to give the just proportion
      of all that is attractive, useful, ornamental, and amiable to the female
      character&mdash;in England, Count Altenberg had hopes of finding a woman
      who, to the noble simplicity of character that was once the charm of
      Switzerland, joined the polish, the elegance, that was once the pride of
      France; a woman possessing an enlarged, cultivated, embellished
      understanding, capable of comprehending all his views as a politician and
      a statesman; yet without any wish for power, or love of political
      intrigue. Graced with knowledge and taste for literature and science,
      capable of being extended to the highest point of excellence, yet free
      from all pedantry, or pretension&mdash;with wit, conversational talents,
      and love of good society, without that desire of exhibition, that
      devouring diseased appetite for admiration, which preys upon the mind
      insatiably, to its torture&mdash;to its destruction; without that
      undefineable, untranslateable French love of <i>succès de société</i>,
      which substitutes a precarious; factitious, intoxicated existence in
      public, for the safe self-approbation, the sober, the permanent happiness
      of domestic life. In England Count Altenberg hoped to find a woman raised
      by "divine philosophy" [Footnote: Milton.] far above all illiberal
      prejudice, but preserving a just and becoming sense of religion;
      unobtrusive, mild, and yet firm. Every thing that he had seen of Caroline
      had confirmed his first hope, and exalted his future expectation; but, by
      what he had just heard, his imagination was checked in full career,
      suddenly, and painfully. His heavenly dream was disturbed by earthly
      voices&mdash;voices of malignant spirits&mdash;mysterious&mdash;indistinct&mdash;yet
      alarming. He had not conceived it possible that the breath of blame could
      approach such a character as Caroline's&mdash;he was struck with surprise,
      and shocked, on hearing her name profaned by common scandal, and spoken of
      as the victim of a disappointed passion, the scorn of one of the most
      distinguished families in England. Such were the first painful thoughts
      and feelings of Count Altenberg. At the time he heard the whispers which
      gave rise to them, he had been actually penning a letter to his father,
      declaring his attachment&mdash;he now resolved not to write. But he
      determined to satisfy himself as to the truth or falsehood of these
      reports. He was not a man to give ear lightly to calumny&mdash;he detested
      its baseness; he would not suffer himself for a moment to brood over
      suspicion, nor yet would he allow himself for present ease and pleasure to
      gloss over, without examination, that which might afterwards recur to his
      mind, and might create future unjust or unhappy jealousy. Either the
      object of his hopes was worthy of him, or not&mdash;if not worthy, better
      tear her from his heart for ever. This determined him to go immediately to
      Mrs. Hungerford's. Count Altenberg trusted to his own address and
      penetration for discovering all he wished to know, without betraying any
      peculiar interest in the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first sight of Mrs. Hungerford, the gracious dignity of her appearance
      and manners, the first five minutes' conversation he had with her, decided
      him in the opinion, that common report had done her justice; and raised in
      his mind extreme anxiety to know her opinion of Caroline. But, though he
      began the history of Zara, and of the play at Falconer-court, for the
      express purpose of introducing the Percys, in speaking of the company who
      had been present, yet, conscious of some unusual emotion when he was going
      to pronounce that name, and fancying some meaning in Mrs. Hungerford's
      great attention as he spoke, he mentioned almost every other guest, even
      the most insignificant, without speaking of Caroline, or of any of her
      family. He went back to his friend Colonel Hungerford. Mrs. Hungerford
      opened a letter-case, and took from it the last letter she had received
      from her son since he left England, containing some interesting
      particulars.&mdash;Towards the conclusion of the letter, the writing
      changed to a small feminine hand, and all India vanished from the view of
      Count Altenberg, for, as he turned the page, he saw the name of Caroline
      Percy: "I suppose I ought to stop here," said he, offering the letter to
      Mrs. Hungerford. "No," she replied, the whole letter was at his service&mdash;they
      were only a few lines from her daughter Lady Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      These few lines mentioned Caroline Percy among the dear and intimate
      friends whom she regretted most in Europe, and to whom she sent a message
      expressive of the warmest affection and esteem. A glow of joy instantly
      diffused itself over his whole frame. As far as related to Colonel
      Hungerford, he was sure that all he had heard was false. There was little
      probability that his wife should, if those circumstances were true, he
      Caroline's most intimate friend. Before these thoughts had well arranged
      themselves in his head, a pleasing, sprightly young lady came into the
      room, who he at first thought was Mrs. Hungerford's daughter; but she was
      too young to answer exactly the description of Mrs. Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Mary Pembroke, my niece," said Mrs. Hungerford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship was followed by Mr. Barclay&mdash;Count Altenberg seemed in a
      fair way to have all his doubts satisfied; but, in the hurry of his mind,
      he had almost forgotten to ask for Mrs. Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not see her to-day," said Mrs. Hungerford; "she is gone to see
      some friends, who live at distance too great for a morning visit. But I
      hope," continued Mrs. Hungerford, turning to Lady Mary, "that my daughter
      will make me amends for losing a day of her company, by bringing me our
      dear Caroline to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there a chance of Caroline's coming to us?" cried Lady Mary with
      affectionate eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there any hope of our seeing Miss Caroline Percy?" said Mr. Barclay,
      with an air of respectful regard, very different from what must have been
      the feelings of a man who had trifled with a woman, or who had thought
      that she had trifled with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg rejoiced that he had come without a moment's delay to
      Hungerford Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are really a good creature, my dear," continued Mrs. Hungerford to
      Lady Mary, "for being so anxious to have Caroline here&mdash;many a niece
      might be jealous of my affection, for certainly I love her as well as if
      she were my own child. To-morrow, sir," said she, turning to Count
      Altenberg, "I hope I shall have the pleasure to introduce you to this
      young friend of ours: I shall feel proud to show her to a foreigner, whom
      I wish to prepossess in favour of my countrywomen."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count said that he had already had the honour of being presented to
      Miss Caroline Percy&mdash;that he had seen her frequently at
      Falconer-court, and at her own home&mdash;and that he was not surprised at
      the interest which she excited at Hungerford Castle. Count Altenberg
      showed the interest she had excited in his own mind, whilst he pronounced,
      in the most sober manner in his power, those few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hungerford perceived it, nor had it escaped her observation, that he
      had forborne to mention the name of Percy when enumerating the persons he
      had met at Falconer-court. She was both too well bred in general, and too
      discreet on Caroline's account, to take any notice of this circumstance.
      She passed immediately and easily to a different subject of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Mrs. Mortimer returned with Caroline. The Count saw the
      affection with which she was embraced by Mrs. Hungerford. The family had
      crowded to the door of the antechamber to receive her, so that Caroline,
      encompassed with friends, could not immediately see the Count, and he
      enjoyed these moments so exquisitely, that the idea which had previously
      engrossed all his soul, anxiety to see how she would look on meeting him
      thus unexpectedly, was absolutely forgotten. When the crowd opened, and
      Mrs. Hungerford led her forward, a smile of frank surprise and pleasure
      appeared on her countenance upon seeing Count Altenberg; but her colour
      had been previously so much raised, and so much pleasure had sparkled in
      her eyes, that there was no judging what share of emotion was to be
      attributed to this surprise. He was, and he had reason to be, satisfied
      with perceiving, that in the midst of the first pleasure of meeting
      intimate friends, and when she did not expect to meet any but friends, she
      was not chilled by the sight of one who was, to her, as yet but a new
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      After introducing Count Altenberg to Mrs. Mortimer, Mrs. Hungerford said,
      "Till I had my daughter and all my friends in full force about me, I
      prudently did not make any attempt, Count Altenberg, upon your liberty;
      but now that you see my resources, I trust you will surrender yourself,
      without difficulty, my prisoner, as long as we can possibly detain you in
      this castle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was man less disposed to refuse an invitation than Count Altenberg
      at this moment. He wrote to Mrs. Falconer immediately that farewell note
      which had shocked Miss Georgiana so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lord Oldborough was preparing to return to town, and likely to be
      engrossed by ministerial business, his lordship, with less reluctance,
      relinquished his company; and the Count, with infinite satisfaction, found
      himself established at once upon a footing of intimacy at Hungerford
      Castle. The letter he had intended to write to his father was now written
      and sent; but it was expressed in yet stronger terms than he had
      originally designed&mdash;he concluded by conjuring his father, as he
      valued the happiness of his son, not to take a step in any of the treaties
      of marriage that had been planned for him, and besought him to write as
      soon as it was possible, to relieve his mind from suspense, and to set him
      at liberty to declare his attachment, if, upon further acquaintance with
      the English lady who had touched his heart, he should feel any hope of
      making such an impression on her affections as could induce her to make
      for him the great sacrifice of country, family, and friends. In the mean
      time, the hours and days passed on most happily at Hungerford Castle.
      Every succeeding day discovered to him some new excellence in the object
      of his affection. Mrs. Hungerford, with judicious, delicate kindness,
      forbore all attempts to display even those qualities and talents in
      Caroline which she most valued, certain that she might safely leave them
      to the discernment of her lover. That Count Altenberg loved, Mrs.
      Hungerford had too much penetration to doubt; and it rejoiced her heart,
      and satisfied all her hopes, to see a prospect of her young friend being
      united to such a man. Mrs. Mortimer felt as much joy and as much delicacy
      upon the subject as her mother showed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that near examination in domestic life, so dangerous to many women of
      the highest pretensions, Caroline shone superior. His love, approved by
      the whole strength of his reason, and exalted by the natural enthusiasm of
      his temper, was now at the highest. His impatience was extreme for the
      arrival of that answer to his letter, which he hoped would set him at
      liberty to declare his passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter at last arrived; very different were its contents from what he
      had hoped. A previous letter from his father to him, sent in a packet with
      government despatches by Mr. Cunningham Falconer, had not reached him.
      That letter, of which his father now sent him a copy, contained an account
      of the steps which had been taken, relative to a treaty of marriage
      between his son and the Countess Christina, a lady of high birth, beauty,
      and talents, who had lately appeared for the first time at that court.
      Count Altenberg's father described the countess as one who, he was sure,
      must charm his son; and as the alliance was eagerly desired by the lady's
      friends, and in every respect honourable for his whole family, the old
      Count was impatient to have the affair concluded. Receiving no answer to
      this letter, and pressed by circumstances, he had gone forward in his
      son's name with the treaty, and had pledged him so far, that there was
      now, he declared, no possibility of retracting with honour. He lamented
      that his son should, in the mean time, have taken a fancy to an English
      lady; but, as Count Albert's letter gave the assurance to his family that
      he would not take any decisive step till he should receive an answer,
      nothing could have been done in England that would commit his honour&mdash;absence
      would soon efface a transient impression&mdash;the advantages of the
      alliance proposed in his own country would appear stronger the more they
      should be examined&mdash;the charms of the Countess Christina, with her
      superior understanding, would have an irresistible effect; "and,"
      concluded the old count, "I beseech you, my dear Albert, as your friend&mdash;I
      will say more&mdash;<i>I command you as your father</i>, return to your
      own country as soon as you can obtain passports after receiving this
      letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg would have left Hungerford Castle immediately, but he had
      still a lingering hope that his last letter to his father would produce a
      change in his mind, and for an answer to this he determined to wait; but a
      sudden change appeared in his manner: he was grave and absent; instead of
      seeking Caroline's company and conversation as usual, he studiously
      avoided her; and when he did speak to her, his behaviour was so cold and
      reserved&mdash;so unlike his natural or his former manner, that the
      difference struck not only Caroline herself, but Rosamond and Mrs. Percy,
      who were, at this time, at Hungerford Castle. It happened that, on the
      very day, and nearly at the very hour, when Count Altenberg received this
      letter from his father, of which no one knew any thing but himself, there
      arrived at Hungerford Castle another of Mrs. Hungerford's nieces, a young
      lady of uncommon beauty, and of the most attractive and elegant manners,
      Lady Florence Pembroke. She was just returned from Italy with an uncle,
      who had resided there for some time. Count Altenberg, from the moment he
      was introduced to Lady Florence, devoted to her his whole attention&mdash;he
      sat beside her&mdash;whenever he conversed, his conversation was addressed
      to her; and the evident absence of mind he occasionally betrayed, and all
      the change in his manner, seemed to have been caused by her ladyship's
      appearance. Some sage philosophers know little more of cause and effect
      than that the one precedes the other; no wonder then that Rosamond, not
      famous for the accuracy of her reasoning, should, in this instance, be
      misled by appearances. To support her character for prudence, she
      determined not to seem to observe what passed, and not to mention her
      suspicions to her sister; who, as she remarked, was sensible of the
      count's altered manner; and who, as she rightly conjectured, did not
      perceive it with indifference. The accomplishments, good sense, and
      exalted sentiments of Count Altenberg, and the marked attentions he had
      paid her, had made an unusual impression on the mind of Caroline. He had
      never declared his love, but involuntarily it had betrayed itself on
      several occasions. Insensibly Caroline was thus led to feel for him more
      than she dared to avow even to herself, when the sudden change in his
      manner awakened her from this delightful forgetfulness of every object
      that was unconnected with her new feelings, and suddenly arrested her
      steps as she seemed entering the paradise of love and hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, when they were retiring to rest, and Caroline and Rosamond were
      in their mother's room, Rosamond, unable longer to keep her prudent
      silence, gave vent to her indignation against Count Altenberg in general
      reflections upon the fickleness of man. Even men of the best understanding
      were, she said, but children of a larger growth&mdash;pleased with change&mdash;preferring
      always the newest to the fairest, or the best. Caroline did not accede to
      these accusations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond, astonished and provoked, exclaimed, "Is it possible that you are
      so blind as not to see that Count Altenberg&mdash;" Rosamond stopped
      short, for she saw Caroline's colour change. She stood beside her mother
      motionless, and with her eyes fixed on the ground. Rosamond moved a chair
      towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, my dear love," said her mother, tenderly taking Caroline's hand&mdash;"sit
      down and compose yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear mother, you required one, and but one promise from me&mdash;I
      gave it you, firmly intending to keep it; and yet I fear that you will
      think I have broken it. I promised to tell you whenever I felt the first
      symptom of preference for any person. I did not know my own mind till this
      day. Indeed I thought I felt nothing but what every body else expressed,
      esteem and admiration."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In common minds," replied Mrs. Percy, "esteem and admiration may be very
      safely distant from love; but in such a mind as yours, Caroline, the step
      from perfect esteem to love is dangerously near&mdash;scarcely
      perceptible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why dangerously?" cried Rosamond: "why should not perfect love follow
      perfect esteem? that is the very thing I desire for Caroline. I am sure he
      <i>is</i> attached to her, and he is all we could wish for her, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop!" cried Caroline. "Oh! my dear sister! as you wish me to be good and
      happy, name him to me no more&mdash;for it cannot be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" exclaimed Rosamond, with a look of dismay: "Why cannot it be? It
      can, it must&mdash;it shall be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline sighed, and turning from her sister, as if she dreaded to listen
      to her, she repeated, "No;&mdash;I will not flatter myself&mdash;I see
      that it cannot be&mdash;I have observed the change in his manner. The pain
      it gave me first awakened me to the state of my own affections. I have
      given you some proof of sincerity by speaking thus immediately of the
      impression made on my mind. You will acknowledge the effort was difficult.&mdash;Mother,
      will you answer me one question&mdash;which I am afraid to ask&mdash;did
      you, or do you think that any body else perceived my sentiments by my
      manner?" Caroline paused, and her mother and sister set her heart at ease
      on that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," said Rosamond, addressing herself to her mother, "I may be
      mistaken in what I hinted about Count Altenberg. I own I thought the
      change in his manner arose from Lady Florence Pembroke&mdash;I am sorry I
      said any thing of it&mdash;I dare say when he sees more of her&mdash;she
      is very pretty, very pleasing, very elegant, and amiable, no doubt; but
      surely, in comparison with Caroline&mdash;but I am not certain that there
      is any rivalship in the case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am certain that there shall be none," said Caroline. "How extraordinary
      it is that the best, the noblest, the most delightful feelings of the
      heart, may lead to the meanest, the most odious! I have, within a few
      hours, felt enough to be aware of this. I will leave nothing to chance. A
      woman should never expose herself to any hazard. I will preserve my peace
      of mind, my own esteem. I will preserve my dear and excellent friends; and
      that I may preserve some of them, I am sensible that I must now quit
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Percy was going to speak, but Rosamond interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! what have I done!" exclaimed she: "imprudent creature that I was, why
      did I speak? why did I open your eyes, Caroline? I had resolved not to say
      a single word of the change I perceived in the Count."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did you think I should not perceive it?" said Caroline. "Oh, you
      little know how quickly&mdash;the first look&mdash;the first tone of his
      voice&mdash;But of that I will think no more. Only let me assure you, that
      you, my dear Rosamond, did no harm&mdash;it was not what any body said
      that alarmed me: before you pointed it out, I had felt that change in his
      manner, for which I cannot account."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot account?&mdash;Can you doubt that Lady Florence is the cause?"
      said Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I have great doubts," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So have I," said Mrs. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot believe," said Caroline, "that a man of his sense and character
      would be so suddenly captivated: I do not mean to detract from Lady
      Florence's merits, but before they could make the impression you suspect
      on Count Altenberg, there must have been time for them to be known and
      appreciated. Shall I go on, and tell you all that has passed in my mind?
      Yes, my mother and sister should see me as I am&mdash;perhaps under the
      delusion of vanity&mdash;or self-love&mdash;or&mdash;But if I am wrong,
      you will set me right&mdash;you will help me to set myself right: it has
      never been declared in words, therefore perhaps I am vain and presumptuous
      to believe or to imagine&mdash;yet I do feel persuaded that I am preferred&mdash;that
      I am&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Loved! Oh, yes!" said Rosamond, "a thousand times I have thought so, I
      have felt certain, that Count Altenberg loved you; but now I am convinced,
      alas! of my mistake&mdash;convinced at least that his love is of that
      light, changeable sort, which is not worth having&mdash;not worth your
      having."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That last," cried Caroline, "I can never believe." She stopped, and
      blushed deeply. "What does my mother say?" added she, in a timid voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother, I am sure, thought once that he loved Caroline&mdash;did not
      you, mother?" said Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear," answered Mrs. Percy, "I have thought so, and I am not yet
      convinced that we were mistaken; but I entirely agree with Caroline that
      this is a subject upon which we ought not to let our thoughts dwell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! so I have thought, so I have said on former occasions, how often, how
      sincerely!" said Caroline. "But this is the first time I ever felt it
      difficult to practise what I know to be wise and right. Mother, I beg it
      as a favour that you will take me away from this place&mdash;this place,
      where but yesterday I thought myself so happy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why, Caroline&mdash;why, mother, should she do this?" expostulated
      Rosamond. "If she thinks, if you think that he loves her, if you do not
      believe that he has changed, if you do not believe that he is struck with
      a new face, why should Caroline go? For Heaven's sake do not take her away
      till you are sure that it is necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will be guided by her opinion," said Mrs. Percy; "I can depend entirely
      on her own prudence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I think it will be most prudent that I should not indulge myself
      in staying longer," said Caroline. "From what I have seen of Count
      Altenberg, we have reason to think that he acts in general from wise and
      good motives. We should therefore believe that in the present instance his
      motives are good and adequate&mdash;I cannot suspect that he acts from
      caprice: what the nature of the obstacle may be, I can only guess; but I
      am inclined to think that some opposing duty&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His duty," said Rosamond, "I suppose he must have known before to-day.
      What new duty can he have discovered? No, no; men are not so very apt in
      love matters to think of opposing duties as women do: much more likely
      that he has heard something to your disadvantage, Caroline, from the
      Falconers. I can tell you that Lady Frances Arlington gave me a hint that
      strange things had been said, and great pains taken to misrepresent you to
      the count."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If injurious representations have been made of me to him," replied
      Caroline, "he will in time discover the falsehood of such report; or, if
      he believe them without examination, he is not what I imagine him to be.
      No; I am convinced he has too noble a mind, too just an understanding, to
      be misled by calumny."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Percy declared she was decidedly of this opinion. "The obstacle,
      whatever it may be, my dear mother," continued Caroline, with the earnest
      tone and expression of countenance of a person of strong mind, at once
      feeling and thinking deeply, "the difficulty, whatever it is, must be
      either such as time will obviate or increase; the obstacle must be either
      conquerable or unconquerable: if he love me, as I thought he did, if he
      have the energy of character I think he possesses, he will conquer it, if
      it can be conquered; if it be unconquerable, what misery, what madness, to
      suffer my affections to be irrevocably engaged! or what base vanity to
      wish, if it were in my power, to inspire him with an unhappy passion!
      Then, in every point of view, mother, surely it is best that I should
      leave this&mdash;dangerous place," said Caroline, smiling. "Yet you are
      both so happy here, I am sorry to be the cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My love," said her mother, "to us all things are trifles, compared with
      what it is right and becoming that you should do. I entirely approve and
      applaud your prudence and resolution: what you desire shall be done as
      soon as possible. We will go home to-morrow morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear ma'am! so suddenly! consider," cried Rosamond, "how very
      strange this will appear to Mrs. Hungerford, and to every body!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Rosamond, these are some of the small difficulties, the false
      delicacies, which so often prevent people from doing what is right, or
      what is essentially necessary for the security of the peace and happiness
      of their whole lives," said Mrs. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true," replied Rosamond; "and I do not object to doing the thing,
      but I only wish we had some good, decent excuse for running away: you
      don't expect that Mrs. Hungerford will part with you without remonstrance,
      without struggle, without even inquiring, why you must run away? I am sure
      I hope she will not ask me, for I am not prepared with an answer, and my
      face would never do, and would give way at the first glance of her
      penetrating eye&mdash;what will you say to Mrs. Hungerford?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The truth," replied Caroline. "Mrs. Hungerford has ever treated me with
      so much kindness, has shown me so much affection and esteem, feels such a
      warm interest in all that concerns me, and is herself of so noble a
      character, that she commands my entire confidence&mdash;and she shall have
      it without reserve. Since my mother agrees with me in thinking that Lady
      Florence has not been in any degree the cause of the change of manner we
      have observed, there can be no impropriety on that account in our speaking
      of the subject to Mrs. Hungerford. It may be painful, humiliating&mdash;but
      what is meant by confidence, by openness towards our friends?&mdash;We are
      all of us ready enough to confess our virtues," said she, smiling; "but
      our weaknesses, what humbles our pride to acknowledge, we are apt to find
      some delicate reason for keeping secret. Mother, if you do not disapprove
      of it, I wish you to tell Mrs. Hungerford the whole truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Percy entirely approved of Caroline's placing confidence in this
      excellent friend. She observed, that this was very different from the
      girlish gossiping sort of <i>confidences</i>, which are made often from
      one young lady to another, merely from the want of something to say, or
      the pleasure of prattling about love, or the hope of being encouraged by
      some weak young friend, to indulge some foolish passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, before Mrs. Hungerford had left her apartment, Mrs.
      Percy went to her, and explained the reasons which induced Caroline to
      refuse herself the pleasure of prolonging her visit at Hungerford Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hungerford was touched by the confidence which Caroline placed in
      her. "Believe me," said she, "it is not misplaced&mdash;I feel all its
      value. And must I lose her? I never parted with her without regret, and
      that regret increases the more I see of her. I almost forget that she is
      not my own, till I am called upon to relinquish her: but much as I value
      her, much as I enjoy her society, I cannot be so selfish as to wish to
      detain her when her peace of mind is at stake. How few, how very few are
      there, of all the various young women I know, who would have the good
      sense and resolution, I will say it, the integrity of mind, to act as she
      does! There is usually some sentimental casuistry, some cowardly fear, or
      lingering hope, that prevents young people in these circumstances from
      doing the plain right thing&mdash;any thing but the plain right thing they
      are ready to do&mdash;and there is always some delicate reason for not
      telling the truth, especially to their friends; but <i>our</i> daughters,
      Mrs. Percy, are above these things." With respect to Count Altenberg, Mrs.
      Hungerford said, that, from many observations she had made, she felt no
      doubt of his being strongly attached to Caroline. "Their characters, their
      understandings, are suited to each other; they have the same high views,
      the same magnanimity. With one exception&mdash;you must allow a mother's
      partiality to make an exception in favour of her own son&mdash;with one
      exception Count Altenberg is the man of all others to whom I could wish to
      see Caroline united. I never till yesterday doubted that it would be; but
      I was as much struck with the change in his manner as you have been. I
      agree with Caroline, that some obstacle, probably of duty, has arisen, and
      I hope&mdash;but no, I will imitate her example, and as you tell me she
      forbids herself to hope, so will I&mdash;if possible. At all events she
      raises herself, high as she was in my esteem, still higher by her present
      conduct. Tell her so, my dear Mrs. Percy&mdash;you, her mother, may give
      this praise, without hurting her delicacy; and tell her that, old as I am,
      I have not forgotten so completely the feelings of my youth, as not to be
      aware that suspense in some situations is the worst of evils. She may be
      assured that my attention shall be as much awake as even her mother's
      could be&mdash;and when any thing that I think important or decisive
      occurs, she shall hear from me immediately, or see me, unless I should
      lose the use of my limbs, or my faculties."
    </p>
    <p>
      A messenger came to summon Mrs. Hungerford to breakfast&mdash;soon
      afterwards a ride was proposed by Mrs. Mortimer. Count Altenberg was to be
      one of this party, and he looked for a moment surprised and disappointed,
      when he found that Caroline was not going with them; but he forebore to
      ask why she did not ride, and endeavoured to occupy himself solely in
      helping Mrs. Mortimer to mount her horse&mdash;Rosamond was glad to
      perceive that he did not well know what he was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they returned from their ride, the Percys were on their way to the
      Hills. Till this moment the sight of home, even after a short absence,
      had, on returning to it, always been delightful to Caroline; but now, for
      the first time in her life, every object seemed to have lost its
      brightness. In the stillness of retirement, which she used to love, she
      felt something sad and lifeless. The favourite glade, which formerly she
      thought the very spot so beautifully described by Dryden, as the scene of
      his "Flower and the Leaf," even this she found had lost its charm. New to
      love, Caroline was not till now aware, that it throws a radiance upon
      every object, which, when passed away, seems to leave all nature changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To banish recollections which she knew that she ought not to indulge, she
      employed herself unremittingly. But her mind did not turn with its wonted
      energy to her occupations, nor was it acted upon by those small motives of
      ordinary life, by which it had formerly been excited. When reading, her
      thoughts would wander even from her favourite authors: every subject they
      discussed would remind her of some conversation that had passed at
      Hungerford Castle; some coincidence or difference of opinion would lead
      her to digress; some observation more just or more striking; some better
      expression, or some expression which pleased her better than the author's,
      would occur, and the book was laid down. These digressions of fancy were
      yet more frequent when she was endeavouring to fix her attention to
      drawing, needle-work, or to any other sedentary employment. Exercise she
      found useful. She spent more time than usual in planting and in gardening&mdash;a
      simple remedy; but practical philosophy frequently finds those simple
      remedies the best which Providence has put within the reach of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, soon after her return home, when she was alone and busy in
      her garden, she heard voices at a distance; as they approached nearer, she
      thought she distinguished Mrs. Hungerford's. She listened, and looked
      towards the path whence the voices had come. All was silent&mdash;but a
      minute afterwards, she saw Mrs. Hungerford coming through the narrow path
      in the thicket: Caroline at first sprang forward to meet her, then stopped
      short, her heart beating violently&mdash;she thought that, perhaps, Mrs.
      Hungerford was accompanied by Count Altenberg; but she was alone. Ashamed
      of the hope which had glanced across her mind, and of the sudden stop
      which had betrayed her thoughts, Caroline now went forward, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hungerford embraced her with tenderness, and then assuming a cheerful
      tone, "Your mother and sister wanted to persuade me," said she, "that I
      should never find my way to you&mdash;but I insisted upon it that I could.
      Had I not the instinct of a true friend to guide me?&mdash;So now let me
      sit down and rest myself on this pretty seat&mdash;a very comfortable
      throne!&mdash;and that is saying much for a throne. So these are your
      territories?" continued she, looking round, and talking with an air of
      playfulness, to give Caroline time to recover herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you never invite me to your garden?&mdash;Perhaps, you think me a
      mere fire-side, arm-chair old woman, dead to all the beauties of nature;
      but I can assure you that I have, all my life, from principle, cultivated
      this taste, which I think peculiarly suited to women, salutary not only to
      their health, but to their happiness and their virtues&mdash;their
      domestic virtues, increasing the interest they take in their homes,
      heightening those feelings of associated pleasure which extend from
      persons to places, and which are at once a proof of the strength of early
      attachments and a security for their continuance to the latest period of
      life. Our friend, Count Altenberg, was observing to me the other day that
      we Englishwomen, among our other advantages, from our modes of life, from
      our spending so many months of the year in the country, have more
      opportunity of forming and indulging these tastes than is usual among
      foreign ladies in the same rank of life. Fortunately for us, we are not
      like Mr. Clay's French countess, or duchess, who declared that she hated
      innocent pleasures."
    </p>
    <p>
      After mentioning French Clay, Mrs. Hungerford passed to a comparison
      between him and Count Altenberg. She had met Mr. Clay in town, and
      disliked him. "He is an Englishman only by birth, and a Frenchman only by
      affectation; Count Altenberg, on the contrary, a foreigner by birth, has
      all the tastes and principles that make him worthy to be an Englishman. I
      am convinced that, if he had liberty of choice, he would prefer residing
      in England to living in any country in the world. Indeed, he expressed
      that sentiment at parting from us yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is gone then," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is, my love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline wished to ask where? and whether he was gone for ever? Yet she
      continued silent&mdash;and became extremely pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hungerford, without appearing to take any notice of her emotion,
      continued, and answered all the questions which she wished to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is gone back to Germany to his own court&mdash;recalled, as he told
      me, by some imperious duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline revived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far you see, my dear, we were right, as those usually are who judge
      from general principles. It was not, indeed, to be credited," continued
      Mrs. Hungerford, "that a man of his character and understanding should act
      merely from caprice. What the nature of the duty may be, whether relating
      to his duty as a public or a private man, he did not explain&mdash;the
      latter, I fear: I apprehend some engagement, that will prevent his return
      to England. In this case he has done most honourably, at whatever risk or
      pain to himself, to avoid any attempt to engage your affections, my dear;
      and you have, in these trying circumstances, acted as becomes your sex and
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so," said Caroline, timidly: "my mother and Rosamond endeavoured
      to re-assure me on one point&mdash;you have seen more since, and must
      therefore be better able to judge&mdash;Count Altenberg has none of that
      presumption of manner which puts a woman upon her guard against his <i>inferences</i>.
      But, in secret, do you think he ever suspected&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot, my love, tell what passes in the secret recesses of man's heart&mdash;much
      more difficult to penetrate than woman's," replied Mrs. Hungerford,
      smiling. "But let this satisfy you&mdash;by no word, hint, or look, could
      I ever guess that he had formed such a hope. Of your whole family he spoke
      in terms of the highest regard. Of you he dared not trust himself to say
      much; but the little he did venture to say was expressive of the highest
      respect and esteem: more he did not, and ought not, I am convinced, to
      have allowed himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am satisfied&mdash;quite satisfied," said Caroline, relieving her heart
      by a deep sigh; "and I thank you, my kind Mrs. Hungerford. You have put
      this subject at rest for ever in my mind. If Count Altenberg <i>can</i>
      love me with honour, he will; if he cannot, Heaven forbid I should wish
      it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time forward Caroline never spoke more upon the subject, never
      mentioned the name of Count Altenberg. She exerted all the strong command
      she possessed over herself to conquer the languor and indolence to which
      she had found herself disposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a difficult task to restore what may be called the tone of the mind,
      to recover the power of being acted upon by common and every day motives,
      after sensibility has been unusually excited. Where the affections have
      been deeply and long engaged, this is a task which the most severe
      philosophy cannot accomplish without the aid of time&mdash;and of that
      superior power which it would be irreverent here to name.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using no concealment with her friends, by permitting no self-delusion,
      by having the courage to confess the first symptom of partiality of which
      she was conscious, Caroline put it out of her own power to nourish a
      preference into a passion which must ultimately have made herself and her
      friends unhappy. Besides the advantages which she derived from her
      literary tastes, and her habits of varying her occupations, she at this
      time found great resources in her warm and affectionate attachment to her
      own family.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never yet arrived at that state of <i>egoisme</i>, which marks the
      height of passion, when all interests and affections sink and vanish
      before one exclusive and tyrant sentiment.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Count Altenberg went to London to obtain his passports, he went to
      pay his parting respects to Lord Oldborough, whose talents and uncommon
      character had made an indelible impression on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he asked whether his lordship had any commands that he could execute
      at his own court, he was surprised by receiving at once a commission of a
      difficult and delicate nature. Lord Oldborough, whose penetration had seen
      into Count Altenberg's character, and who knew how and when to trust,
      though he was supposed to be the most reserved of men, confided to the
      Count his dissatisfaction with the proceedings of Cunningham Falconer; his
      suspicions that the envoy was playing double, and endeavouring to
      ingratiate himself abroad and at home with a party inimical to his
      lordship's interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diplomatists are all, more or less, insincere," said Lord Oldborough.
      "But to have chosen an envoy who joins ingratitude to duplicity would
      reflect no credit upon the minister by whom he was appointed. Were I
      speaking to a common person, I should not admit the possibility of my
      having committed such an error. But Count Altenberg will judge by the
      whole and not by a part. He knows that every man <i>in power</i> is
      sometimes the slave of circumstances. This Cunningham Falconer&mdash;all
      these Falconers were forced upon me&mdash;how, it is of little consequence
      to you to hear. It is sufficient for me to assure you, Count, that it was
      not my judgment that erred. Now the necessity has ceased. By other means
      my purpose has been accomplished. The Falconers are useless to me. But I
      will not abandon those whom I have undertaken to protect, till I have
      proof of their perfidy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough then explained the points on which he desired to inform
      himself before he should decide with regard to Cunningham. Count Altenberg
      undertook to procure for his lordship the means of ascertaining the
      fidelity of his envoy; and Lord Oldborough then turned the conversation on
      general politics. He soon perceived that the Count was not as much
      interested in these subjects as formerly. At parting, Lord Oldborough
      smiled, and said, "You have been, since I saw you last, Count Altenberg,
      too much in the company of a philosopher, who prefers the happiness of a
      country gentleman's life to the glory of a statesman's career. But height
      will soon recall high thoughts. Ambition is not dead, only dormant within
      you. It will, I hope and trust, make you in time the minister and pride of
      your country. In this hope I bid you farewell."
    </p>
    <p>
      Commissioner Falconer having been told, by one of the people in the
      antechamber, that Count Altenberg had arrived, and was now with the
      minister, waited anxiously to see him, caught him in his way out, and
      eagerly pressed an invitation from Mrs. Falconer to dine or spend the
      evening with them&mdash;but the Count had now his passports, and pleaded
      the absolute necessity for his immediately setting out on his return to
      his own country. The commissioner, from a word or two that he hazarded
      upon the subject, had the vexation to perceive that his hopes of engaging
      Count Altenberg to assist the views of his son Cunningham were vain, and
      he regretted that he had wasted so much civility upon a foreigner who
      would make him no return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Georgiana Falconer's mortification at the Count's leaving England was
      much alleviated by finding that he had not been detained by the charms of
      Miss Caroline Percy, and she was almost consoled for losing the prize
      herself, by seeing that it had not been won by her rival. Mrs. Falconer,
      too, though she had long abandoned all hopes of the Count as a son-in-law,
      yet rejoiced to be spared the humiliation of writing to congratulate Mr.
      and Mrs. Percy upon the marriage and splendid establishment of their
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all, how ill they have managed!" said Mrs. Falconer; "the game was
      in their own hands. Certainly Mrs. Percy must be the worst mother in the
      world, and the daughter, with all her sense, a perfect simpleton, or they
      might have made up the match when they had the Count to themselves at
      Hungerford Castle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you long ago, but you would never believe, Mrs. Falconer," cried
      the commissioner, "that Count Altenberg's ruling passion was ambition, and
      that he was not the least likely to fall in love, as you ladies call it.
      The old Prince of &mdash;&mdash; is going fast, and Count Altenberg's
      father has sent for him, that he may be on the spot to secure his favour
      with the hereditary prince&mdash;I am sure I hope Count Altenberg will not
      be minister; for from the few words he said to me just now when I met him,
      he will not enter into my views with regard to Cunningham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, those political visions of yours, commissioner, seldom end in any
      thing but disappointment," said Mrs. Falconer. "I always said it would be
      so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a scene of recrimination, such as was the usual consequence
      of the failure of any of the plans of this intriguing pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, Mrs. Falconer," concluded the commissioner, "I augur as ill of your
      present scheme for Georgiana as I did of the last. You will find that all
      your dinners and concerts will be just as much thrown away upon the two
      Clays as your balls and plays were upon Count Altenberg. And this is the
      way, ma'am, you go on plunging me deeper and deeper in debt," said the
      commissioner, walking about the room much disturbed, "If any thing was to
      go wrong with Lord Oldborough, what would become of us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, that is a very unseasonable apprehension; for Lord Oldborough,
      as I hear on all sides, is firmer in power now than he ever was&mdash;of
      that, you know, you were but yesterday giving me assurance and proof. His
      favour, you know, is so high, that all who were leagued against him in
      that combination he detected, were, in consequence of his lordship's
      letter, instantly dismissed from office: his colleagues are now of his
      choosing&mdash;the cabinet, I understand, completely his own friends. What
      more security can you desire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't understand me, Mrs. Falconer: I am not thinking of the security
      of Lord Oldborough's power&mdash;of that, after all I have seen, I can
      have no doubt; but I am not so sure of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>The continuance of my own favour</i>," he was going to say, but it was
      painful to him to utter the words, and he had a superstitious dread,
      common to courtiers, of speaking of their decline of favour, Besides, he
      knew that reproaches for want of address in managing Lord Oldborough's
      humour would immediately follow from Mrs. Falconer, if he gave any hint of
      this kind; and on his address the commissioner piqued himself, not without
      reason. Abruptly changing his tone, and taking that air of authority which
      every now and then he thought fit to assume, he said, "Mrs. Falconer,
      there's one thing I won't allow&mdash;I won't allow Georgiana and you to
      make a fool of young Petcalf."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By no means, my love; but if he makes a fool of himself, you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Falconer, you recollect the transaction about the draught."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For Zara's dress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am. The condition you made then in my name with Georgiana I hold
      her to, and I expect that she be prepared to be Mrs. Petcalf within the
      year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told her so, my dear, and she acquiesces&mdash;she submits&mdash;she is
      ready to obey&mdash;if nothing better offers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>If</i>&mdash;Ay, there it is!&mdash;All the time I know you are
      looking to the Clays; and if they fail, somebody else will start up, whom
      you will think a better match than Petcalf, and all these people are to be
      <i>fêted</i>, and so you will go on, wasting my money and your own time.
      Petcalf will run restive at last, you will lose him, and I shall have
      Georgiana left upon my hands after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No danger, my dear. My principle is the most satisfactory and secure
      imaginable. To have a number of tickets in the wheel&mdash;then, if one
      comes up a blank, still you have a chance of a prize in the next. Only
      have patience, Mr. Falconer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Patience! my dear: how can a man have patience, when he has seen the same
      thing going on for years? And I have said the same thing to you over and
      over a hundred times, Mrs. Falconer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hundred times at least, I grant, and that, perhaps, is enough to try my
      patience you'll allow, and yet, you see how reasonable I am. I have only
      to repeat what is incontrovertible, that when a girl has been brought up,
      and has lived in a certain line, you must push her in that line, for she
      will not do in any other. You must be sensible that no mere country
      gentleman would ever think of Georgiana&mdash;we must push her in the line
      for which she is fit&mdash;the fashionable line."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Push! Bless my soul, ma'am! you have been pushing one or other of those
      girls ever since they were in their teens, but your pushing signifies
      nothing. The men, don't you see, back as fast as the women advance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coarse!&mdash;Too coarse an observation for you, commissioner!" said Mrs.
      Falconer, with admirable temper; "but when men are angry they will say
      more than they think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma'am, I don't say half as much as I think&mdash;ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!&mdash;That is a candid confession, for which I owe you credit, at
      all events."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a foolish game&mdash;it's a foolish game&mdash;it's a losing game,"
      continued the commissioner; "and you will play it till we are ruined."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a losing game if it be played with temper and spirit. Many throw up
      the game like cowards, when, if they had but had courage to double the
      bet, they would have made their fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw! Pshaw!" said the commissioner: "Can you double your girls' beauty?
      can you double their fortune?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fashion stands in the place both of beauty and fortune, Mr. Falconer; and
      fashion, my girls, I hope you will allow, enjoy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enjoy! What signifies that? Fashion, you told me, was to win Count
      Altenberg&mdash;has it won him? Are we one bit the better for the expense
      we were at in all those entertainments?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that, or most of it&mdash;at least the popularity-ball&mdash;must be
      set down to Lord Oldborough's account; and that is your affair,
      commissioner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the play, and the play-house, and the dresses! Was Zara's dress my
      affair? Did I not tell you, you were wasting your time upon that man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No waste, nothing has been wasted, my dear commissioner; believe me, even
      in point of economy we could not have laid out money better; for at a
      trifling expense we have obtained for Georgiana the credit of having
      refused Count Altenberg. Lady Kew and Lady Trant have spread the report.
      You know it is not my business to speak&mdash;and now the Count is gone,
      who can contradict it with any propriety?&mdash;The thing is universally
      believed. Every body is talking of it, and the consequence is, Georgiana
      is more in fashion now than ever she was. There's a proposal I had for her
      this morning," said Mrs. Falconer, throwing a letter carelessly before the
      commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A proposal! That is something worth attending to," said the commissioner,
      putting on his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, nothing worth our attention," said Mrs. Falconer, "only eighteen
      hundred a year, which, you know, Georgiana could not possibly live upon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better than nothing, surely," said the commissioner; "let me see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not better than Petcalf, not within a thousand a year so good, putting
      Asia Minor out of the question. So, you know, I could not hesitate an
      instant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I hope your answer was very civil. People are not aware what
      dangerous enemies they make on these occasions," said Mr. Falconer: "I
      hope your answer was very polite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! the pink of courtesy," said Mrs. Falconer. "I lamented that my
      daughter's fortune was so small as to put it out of her power, &amp;c.,
      and I added a great deal about <i>merit</i>, and the <i>honour done our
      family</i>, and so on. But I wonder the man had the assurance to propose
      for Georgiana, when he had nothing better to say for himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Petcalf, to be sure, if the general dies, is a thousand a year better. I
      believe you are right there," said Mr. Falconer; and with an air of
      calculating consideration, he took up a pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what are you about, commissioner? going to write on that letter, as
      if it were waste paper!" said Mrs. Falconer, starting up, and taking it
      hastily from him: "I must have it for Lady Trant, Lady Kew, and some more
      of our intimate friends, that they may be able to say they have seen the
      proposal; for mothers and daughters too, in these days, are so apt to
      boast, that it is quite necessary to have some written document to
      produce, and there's no going beyond <i>that</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly&mdash;quite necessary. And what written document," said the
      commissioner, smiling, "have you to produce in the case of Count
      Altenberg?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! that is another affair," said Mrs. Falconer, smiling in her turn.
      "One must not in all cases have recourse to the same expedients. Besides,
      if we produce our proofs on one occasion, we shall depend upon having our
      word taken on trust another time; and it would be too much to make a
      practice of showing gentlemen's letters: it is not what I should always do&mdash;certainly
      not with regard to a man of Count Altenberg's rank and pretensions, who
      merits to be treated with somewhat more consideration, surely, than a man
      who hazards such a proposal as this. I merely produced it to show you that
      Georgiana is in no absolute distress for admirers. And now, my dear, I
      must trouble you&mdash;those public singers are terribly expensive; yet at
      a concert we must have them, and one cannot have them without coming up to
      their price&mdash;I must trouble you to sign this draft, for our concert
      last week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mrs. Falconer, I have signed it," cried the commissioner, "and it is
      the last, for a similar purpose, I ever will sign&mdash;upon my honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have invited every body to a concert here next week," said Mrs.
      Falconer: "What can I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do as others do," said the commissioner; "let these musical professors
      give a concert at your house: then, instead of paying them, you share
      their profits, and you have the best company at your house into the
      bargain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such things are done, I know," said Mrs. Falconer, "and by people of
      rank; but Lady Jane Granville would not do it, when she was more
      distressed for money than we are, and I know many say it is what they
      would not do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be done by you, Mrs. Falconer, or you must give up having
      concerts altogether," said the commissioner, leaving the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give up concerts was quite impossible, especially as French Clay was,
      or pretended to be, passionately fond of music, and it was at her musical
      parties that he never failed to attend assiduously. The next concert was
      given by a celebrated performer at Mrs. Falconer's house, and she and the
      singers shared the profit. To such meanness can the slaves of fashion
      condescend!
    </p>
    <p>
      At this concert it happened that there was a new and remarkably handsome,
      graceful, female Italian singer, who was much admired by all the gentlemen
      present, and particularly by French Clay, who had set up, with little ear,
      and less taste, for a great judge of music. He was ambitious of appearing
      as the patron of this young performer. He went about every where talking
      of her in raptures, and making interest for her with all the great people
      of his acquaintance. Her own voice and her own charms needed not the
      protection of Mr. Clay; from the night she was first produced at Mrs.
      Falconer's, she became at once the height of the fashion. Every body was
      eager to have her at their parties, especially as she had never yet been
      upon the stage. Admirers crowded round her, and among them were many of
      rank and fortune: an old earl and a young baronet were of the number. The
      ardour of competition so much increased the zeal of French Clay, that what
      was at first only affectation, became real enthusiasm. He was resolved to
      win the lady from all his rivals. He had frequent opportunities of seeing
      her at Mrs. Falconer's, where he appeared always in glory as her patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seraphina, the fair Italian, considering Mrs. Falconer as her first
      patroness, made it a point of gratitude to hold her concerts frequently at
      her house. Mrs. Falconer was proud of the distinction. Fresh éclat was
      thrown upon her and upon her daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      French Clay was always near Miss Georgiana Falconer, or near Seraphina;
      and he applauded each by turns with all the raptures of an amateur. Mrs.
      Falconer saw that rivalship with the old earl and the young baronet had
      worked Mr. Clay into a passion for Seraphina; but she thought she knew how
      a passion for a singer must end, and as this did not interfere with her
      matrimonial designs, it gave her little uneasiness. Bets ran high in the
      fashionable world upon the three candidates. Mrs. Falconer had no doubt
      that the old earl would carry off the prize, as he was extremely rich, and
      was ready to make any settlement and any establishment. Her prophecy
      would, probably, have been accomplished, but that French Clay, strongly
      urged by the immediate danger of losing the lady, and flattered by
      Seraphina's mother, who, in another style of life, was equal to Mrs.
      Falconer in address and knowledge of the world, was drawn in to offer what
      alone could balance the charms of the baronet's youth and of the earl's
      wealth&mdash;a week after the offer was made, Seraphina became Mrs. French
      Clay. Upon this marriage Commissioner Falconer hastened immediately to
      reproach his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! Mrs. Falconer, I told you it would never do&mdash;There is another
      son-in-law who has escaped you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Never did Mrs. Falconer's genius appear so great as in circumstances which
      would have confounded one of inferior resource. It is true, she had been
      thrown into surprise and consternation by the first news of this marriage;
      but by an able stroke she had turned defeat into victory. With a calm air
      of triumph she replied to her husband, "I beg your pardon, Mr. Falconer,&mdash;French
      Clay was only my ostensible object: I should have been very sorry to have
      had him for my son-in-law; for, though it is a secret, I know that he is
      overwhelmed with debt. The son-in-law I really wished for has not escaped
      me, sir&mdash;the elder brother, English Clay&mdash;Clay, of Clay-hall, I
      apprehend, you will allow, is rather a better match for your daughter; and
      his proposal for Georgiana, his relation, Lady Trant, was last night
      authorized to make to me in form. And now, commissioner, there is an end
      of your fears that your daughter should be left, at last, upon your hands;
      and now, I flatter myself, you will acknowledge that I always knew what I
      was about&mdash;mistress of Clay-hall, and of seven thousand a year&mdash;I
      think that is doing pretty well for a girl who has nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner was so much delighted, that he willingly permitted his
      lady to enjoy her triumph over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now only consider, commissioner," she pursued, "if I had huddled up that
      match with Petcalf!&mdash;Petcalf, I'll answer for it, in case of
      necessity, that is, in case of any difficulty on the part of Sir Robert
      Percy, I can turn over to Bell. Poor Petcalf!" added she, with a smile: "I
      really have a regard for that ever-lasting partner, and wish to leave him
      a chance of being partner for life to one of my daughters. I am sure he
      has reason to be excessively obliged to me for thinking of him at this
      moment&mdash;I must go to Georgiana and talk about wedding-clothes, laces,
      jewels, equipages&mdash;Mr. Clay, of Clay-hall, piques himself upon having
      every thing the best of its kind, and in the highest style&mdash;Happy&mdash;happy
      girl!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happy&mdash;happy father, who has got her off his hands!" cried the
      commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Twas my doing&mdash;'twas all my doing!" said Mrs. Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was, my dear; and how was it brought about?" said Mr. Falconer: "stay
      one minute from the wedding-clothes, and tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer returned, and in the pride of successful intrigue explained
      all&mdash;that is, all she chose her husband to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Trant was Mr. Clay's near relation, and Mrs. Falconer's intimate
      friend&mdash;how she had engaged her ladyship so zealously in her cause
      was the point which Mrs. Falconer did not choose to explain, and into
      which the commissioner never thought of inquiring. There are moments in
      which the most selfish may be betrayed into a belief that others act from
      generous motives; and the very principles which they hold infallible
      applied to all other cases, they think admit in their own of an exception:
      so Commissioner Falconer, notwithstanding his knowledge of the world, and
      his knowledge of himself, took it for granted, that, in this instance,
      Lady Trant acted from the impulse of disinterested friendship. This point
      happily admitted without question, all the rest Mrs. Falconer could
      satisfactorily explain. Lady Trant being a friend she could trust
      entirely, Mrs. Falconer had opened her mind to her ladyship, and, by her
      suggestion, Lady Trant had seized the happy moment when English Clay was
      enraged against his brother for his strange marriage, and had deplored
      that Clay-hall, and the fine estate belonging to it, should go to the
      children of an Italian singer: English Clay took fresh fire at this idea,
      and swore that, much as he hated the notion of a wife and children, he had
      a great mind to marry on purpose to punish his brother, and to cut him
      off, as he deserved, for ever from Clay-hall. Lady Trant commended his
      spirit, and urged him to put his resolution into execution&mdash;English
      Clay, however, balked a little at this: women now-a-days, he said, were so
      cursed expensive, that scarce any fortune could suffice for a wife, and
      horses, and all in style; and as to taking a wife, who would not be of a
      piece with the rest of his establishment, that was what he was not the man
      to do. Lady Trant answered, that of course he would wish to have a
      fashionable wife; that was the only thing that was wanting to make
      Clay-hall complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then an establishment that was quite correct, and in the first style
      for a bachelor, would be quite incorrect for a married man, and every
      thing to do over again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True; but then to grow into an old bachelor, and to hear every body
      saying, or to know that every body is saying, behind your back, 'He will
      never marry, you know; and all his estate will go to his brother, or the
      children of Seraphina, the singer.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some men who might feel tired of having the same idea repeated,
      and the self-same words reiterated; but English Clay was not of the
      number: on the contrary, repetition was necessary, in the first place, to
      give his mind time to take in an idea; and afterwards, reiteration was
      agreeable, as it impressed him with a sense of conviction without the
      trouble of thought. After Lady Trant had reiterated a sufficient time, he
      assented, and declared what her ladyship observed was d&mdash;&mdash;d
      true; but after a silence of several minutes, he added, "There's such a
      cursed deal of danger of being <i>taken in</i> by a woman, especially by
      one of those fashionable girls, who are all in the catch-match line." Lady
      Trant, who had been well tutored and prepared with replies by Mrs.
      Falconer, answered that as Mr. Clay, of Clay-hall, had a fortune that
      entitled him to ask any woman, so he was, for the same reason, at full
      liberty to please himself; and though family connexion and fashion would
      of course be indispensable to him, yet money could be no object to a man
      of his fortune&mdash;he was not like many needy young men, obliged to sell
      themselves for a wife's fortune, to pay old debts: no, Lady Trant said,
      she was sure her relation and friend, Mr. Clay, of Clay-hall, would never
      bargain for a wife, and, of course, where there was no bargaining there
      could be no fear of being taken in.
    </p>
    <p>
      English Clay had never considered the matter in this view before; but now
      it was pointed out, he confessed it struck him as <i>very fair&mdash;very
      fair</i>: and his pride, of which he had a comfortable portion, being now
      touched, he asserted both his disinterestedness and his right to judge and
      choose in this business entirely for himself. Who had a right to blame
      him? his fortune was his own, and he would marry a girl without sixpence,
      if she struck his fancy. Lady Trant supported him in his humour, and he
      began to name some of the young ladies of his acquaintance: one would look
      well in a curricle; another would do the honours of his house handsomely;
      another danced charmingly, and would be a credit to him in a ball-room;
      another would make a sweet-tempered nurse when he should have the gout:
      but Lady Trant found some objection to every one he mentioned, till, at
      last, when he had named all he could think of in remainder to his heart,
      Lady Trant proposed Miss Georgiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was intended for his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! no." Lady Trant had very particular reasons for being positive that
      neither Mrs. nor Miss Falconer had ever such an idea, however they might
      have let it go abroad, perhaps, to conceal their real wishes&mdash;Miss
      Georgiana Falconer had refused so many gentlemen&mdash;Count Altenberg,
      report said, among others; and it was plain to Lady Trant that the young
      lady could not be easily pleased&mdash;that her affections were not to be
      engaged very readily: yet she had a notion, she owned, that if&mdash;But
      she was not at liberty to say more. She was only convinced that no girl
      was more admired than Miss Georgiana Falconer, and no woman would do
      greater credit to the taste of a man of fashion: she had all the
      requisites Mr. Clay had named: she would look well in a curricle; she
      would do the honours of his house charmingly; she sung and danced
      divinely: and Lady Trant summed up all by reiterating, that Miss Georgiana
      Falconer never would have married his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      This persuasive flattery, combining with English Clay's anger against his
      brother, had such effect, that he protested, if it was not for the trouble
      of the thing, he did not care if he married next week. But the making the
      proposal, and all that, was an awkward, troublesome business, to which he
      could not bring himself. Lady Trant kindly offered to take all trouble of
      this sort off his hands&mdash;undertook to speak to Mrs. Falconer, if she
      had his authority for so doing, and engaged that he should be married
      without any kind of awkwardness or difficulty. In consequence of this
      assurance, Lady Trant was empowered by Mr. Clay to make the proposal,
      which was received with so much joy and triumph by Mrs. Falconer and by
      her Georgiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their joy and triumph were not of long duration. In this family, where
      none of the members of it acted in concert, or well knew what the others
      were doing,&mdash;where each had some separate interest, vanity, or vice,
      to be pursued or indulged, it often happened that one individual
      counteracted the other, and none were willing to abandon their selfish
      purpose, whether of interest or pleasure. On the present occasion, by a
      curious concatenation of circumstances, it happened that Buckhurst
      Falconer, who had formerly been the spoiled darling of his mother, was the
      person whose interest immediately crossed hers; and if he pursued his
      object, it must be at the risk of breaking off his sister Georgiana's
      marriage with English Clay. It is necessary to go back a few steps to
      trace the progress of Buckhurst Falconer's history. It is a painful task
      to recapitulate and follow the gradual deterioration of a disposition such
      as his; to mark the ruin and degradation of a character which,
      notwithstanding its faults, had a degree of generosity and openness, with
      a sense of honour and quick feeling, which early in life promised well;
      and which, but for parental weakness and mistaken system, might have been
      matured into every thing good and great. After his mother had, by
      introducing him early to fashionable company, and to a life of idleness
      and dissipation, disgusted him with the profession of the law, in which,
      with talents such as his, he might, with application and perseverance,
      have risen to wealth and eminence&mdash;after his father had, by duplicity
      and tyranny, forced him into that sacred profession for which the young
      man felt himself unfit, and which his conscience long refused to consider
      merely as the means of worldly provision&mdash;the next step was to send
      him with a profligate patron, as chaplain to a regiment, notorious for
      gambling. The first sacrifice of principle made, his sense of honour,
      duty, and virtue, once abandoned, his natural sensibility only hastened
      his perversion. He had a high idea of the clerical character; but his past
      habits and his present duties were in direct opposition. Indeed, in the
      situation in which he was placed, and with the society into which he was
      thrown, it would have required more than a common share of civil courage,
      and all the steadiness of a veteran in virtue, to have withstood the
      temptations by which he was surrounded. Even if he had possessed
      sufficient resolution to change his former habits, and to become a good
      clergyman, his companions and his patron, instead of respecting, would
      have shunned him as a censor. Unwilling to give up the pleasures of
      conviviality, and incapable of sustaining the martyrdom of ridicule,
      Buckhurst Falconer soon abjured all the principles to which he could not
      adhere&mdash;he soon gloried in the open defiance of every thing that he
      had once held right. Upon all occasions, afraid of being supposed to be
      subject to any restraint as a clergyman, or to be influenced by any of the
      prejudices of his profession, he strove continually to show his liberality
      and spirit by daring, both in words and actions, beyond what others dared.
      He might have been checked and stopped in his career of extravagance by
      the actual want of money and of credit, had he not unluckily obtained, at
      this early period, a living, as a reward for saving Bishop Clay from being
      choked: this preferment, obtained in circumstances so ludicrous, afforded
      him matter of much temporary amusement and triumph; and confirmed him in
      the idea his father had long laboured to inculcate, that merit was
      unnecessary to rising in the world or in the church. But however he might
      endeavour to blind himself to the truth, and however general opinion was
      shut out from him for a time by those profligate persons with whom he
      lived, yet he could not help now and then seeing and feeling that he had
      lost respectability; and in the midst of noisy merriment he was often to
      himself an object of secret and sad contempt. Soon after he was separated
      for a time from Colonel Hauton and his companions, by going to take
      possession of his living, he made an effort to regain his self-complacency&mdash;he
      endeavoured to distinguish himself as an eloquent preacher.&mdash;Ashamed
      of avowing to his associates better motives, by which he was partly
      actuated, he protested that he preached only for fame and a deanery. His
      talents were such as soon accomplished half his wish, and ensured him
      celebrity&mdash;he obtained opportunities of preaching in a fashionable
      chapel in London&mdash;he was prodigiously followed&mdash;his theatrical
      manner, perhaps, increased the effect of his eloquence upon a certain
      class of his auditors; but the more sober and nice-judging part of his
      congregation objected to this dramatic art and declamatory style, as
      tending to draw the attention from the doctrine to the preacher, and to
      obtain admiration from man more than to do honour to God. This, however,
      might have passed, as a matter of speculative opinion or difference of
      taste; provided the preacher is believed to be in earnest, the style of
      his preaching is of little comparative consequence. But the moment he is
      suspected of being insincere, the moment it is found that he does not
      practise what he preaches, his power over the rational mind ceases; and to
      moral feeling such a clergyman becomes an object, not only of contempt,
      but of disgust and abhorrence. Murmurs were soon heard against the private
      conduct of the celebrated preacher&mdash;perhaps envy for his talents and
      success mingled her voice with the honest expressions of virtuous
      indignation. The murmurs grew louder and louder; and Buckhurst Falconer,
      to avoid having inquiries made and irregularities brought to light, was
      obliged to yield to a rival preacher of far inferior talents, but of more
      correct conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commissioner Falconer was glad that his son was disappointed in this
      manner, as he thought it would make him more attentive than he had been of
      late to Colonel Hauton; and the living of Chipping-Friars was better worth
      looking after than the fleeting fame of a popular preacher. Buckhurst,
      however, still held fame in higher estimation than it had ever been held
      by his father, who never valued it but as subordinate to interest. But the
      love of fame, however superior to mercenary habits, affords no security
      for the stability of conduct; on the contrary, without good sense and
      resolution, it infallibly accelerates the degeneracy of character.
      Buckhurst's hopes of obtaining literary celebrity being lost, he sunk
      another step, and now contented himself with the kind of notoriety which
      can be gained by a man of talents, who condescends to be the wit of
      private circles and of public dinners. Still he met with many competitors
      in this line. In the metropolis, the mendicants for fame, like the
      professional beggars, portion out the town among them, and whoever
      ventures to ply beyond his allotted <i>walk</i> is immediately jostled and
      abused; and the false pretensions of the wit, and all the tricks to obtain
      admiration, are as sure to be exposed by some rivals of the trade, as the
      false legs, arms, and various impostures of the beggar are denounced by
      the brother-beggar, on whose monopoly he has infringed. Our wit was soon
      compelled to confine himself to his own <i>set</i>, and gradually he
      degenerated from being the wit to being the good story-teller of the
      company. A man who lives by pleasing must become whatever the society in
      which he lives desire. Colonel Hauton and his associates had but little
      taste for pure wit&mdash;low humour and facetious stories were more suited
      to their capacities&mdash;<i>slang</i> and buffoonery were their delight.
      Buckhurst had early become a proficient in all these: the respect due to
      the clerical character had not restrained him from the exercise of arts
      for his own amusement, which now he found indispensably requisite for the
      entertainment of others, and to preserve favour with his patron. Contrary
      to all calculation, and, as the commissioner said, to all reasonable
      expectation, the old paralytic incumbent had continued to exist, and so
      many years had passed since the promise had been made to Buckhurst of this
      living, the transaction in consequence of which it was promised was now so
      completely forgotten, that the commissioner feared that Colonel Hauton, no
      longer under the influence of shame, might consider the promise as merely
      gratuitous, not binding: therefore the cautious father was solicitous that
      his son should incessantly stick close to the colonel, who, as it was
      observed, never recollected his absent friends. Buckhurst, though he knew
      him to be selfish and silly, yet had no suspicion of his breaking his
      promise, because he piqued himself on being a man of honour; and little as
      he cared, in general, for any one but himself, Colonel Hauton had often
      declared that he could not live without Buckhurst Falconer. He was always
      driving with the colonel, riding, betting with him, or relieving him from
      the sense of his own inability by making a jest of some person.
      Buckhurst's talents for mimickry were an infallible resource. In
      particular, he could mimick the two Clays to perfection, could take off
      the affected tone, foreign airs, and quick talkative vanity of French
      Clay; and represent the slow, surly reserve, supercilious silence, and
      solemn self-importance of English Clay. He used to imitate not only their
      manners, gesture, and voice, but could hold conversations in their
      characters, fall naturally into their train of thinking, and their modes
      of expression. Once a week, at least, the two Clays were introduced for
      the amusement of their friend Colonel Hauton, who, at the hundredth
      representation, was as well pleased as at the first, and never failed to
      "witness his wonder with an idiot laugh," quite unconscious that, the
      moment afterwards, when he had left the room, this laugh was mimicked for
      the entertainment of the remainder of the band of friends. It happened one
      night that Buckhurst Falconer, immediately after Colonel Hauton had
      quitted the party, began to set the table in a roar, by mimicking his
      laugh, snuffling voice, and silly observations; when, to his utter
      confusion, his patron, who he thought had left the room, returned from
      behind a screen, and resumed his place opposite to Buckhurst. Not Banquo's
      ghost could have struck more terror into the heart of the guilty.
      Buckhurst grew pale as death, and sudden silence ensued. Recovering his
      presence of mind, he thought that it was possible the colonel might be
      such a fool as not to have recognized himself; so by a wink to one of the
      company, and a kick under the table to another, he endeavoured to make
      them join in his attempt to pass off the whole as mimickry of a Colonel <i>Hallerton</i>.
      His companions supported him as he continued the farce, and the laughter
      recommenced. Colonel Hauton filled his glass, and said nothing; by
      degrees, however, he joined or pretended to join in the laugh, and left
      the company without Buckhurst's being able exactly to determine whether he
      had duped him or not. After the colonel was fairly gone,&mdash;for this
      time Buckhurst took care not only to look behind the screen, but even to
      shut the doors of the antechamber, and to wait till he heard the parting
      wheels,&mdash;they held a conference upon the question&mdash;duped or not
      duped? All agreed in flattering Buckhurst that he had completely succeeded
      in giving <i>the colonel the change</i>, and he was particularly
      complimented on his address by a Mr. Sloak, chaplain to a nobleman, who
      was one of the company. There was something of a hypocritical tone in
      Sloak's voice&mdash;something of a doubtful cast in his eyes, which, for a
      moment, raised in Buckhurst's mind a suspicion of him. But, the next day,
      Colonel Hauton appeared as usual. Buckhurst rode, drove, and jested with
      him as before; and the whole transaction was, on his part, forgotten. A
      month afterwards the rector of Chipping-Friars actually died&mdash;Commissioner
      Falconer despatched an express to Buckhurst, who stood beside his bed,
      with the news, the instant he opened his eyes in the morning. Buckhurst
      sent the messenger on to Colonel Hauton's at the barracks, and before
      Buckhurst was dressed, the colonel's groom brought him an invitation to
      meet a large party at dinner: "the colonel would be unavoidably engaged,
      by regimental business, all morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst's friends and acquaintance now flocked to congratulate him, and,
      by dinner-time, he had, in imagination, disposed of the second year's
      tithes, and looked out for a curate to do the duty of Chipping-Friars. The
      company assembled at dinner, and the colonel seemed in uncommonly good
      spirits, Buckhurst jovial and triumphant&mdash;nothing was said of the
      living, but every thing was taken for granted. In the middle of dinner the
      colonel cried, "Come, gentlemen, fill your glasses, and drink with me to
      the health of the new rector of Chipping-Friars." The glasses were filled
      instantly, all but Buckhurst Falconer's, who, of course, thought he should
      not drink his own health.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Sloak, I have the pleasure to drink your health; Mr. Sloak, rector of
      Chipping-Friars," cried the patron, raising his voice. "Buckhurst," added
      he, with a malicious smile, "you do not fill your glass."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst sat aghast. "Colonel, is this a jest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A jest?&mdash;by G&mdash;&mdash;! no," said the colonel; "I have had
      enough of jests and jesters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can this mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It means," said the colonel, coolly, "that, idiot as you take me, or make
      me to be, I'm not fool enough to patronize a mimick to mimick myself; and,
      moreover, I have the good of the church too much at heart, to make a <i>rector</i>
      of one who has no rectitude&mdash;I can have my pun, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      The laugh was instantly turned against Buckhurst. Starting from table, he
      looked alternately at Colonel Hauton and at Mr. Sloak, and could scarcely
      find words to express his rage. "Hypocrisy! Treachery! Ingratitude!
      Cowardice! If my cloth did not protect you, you would not dare&mdash;Oh!
      that I were not a clergyman!" cried Buckhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a good time to wish it, faith!" said the colonel; "but you should
      have thought better before you put on the cloth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cursing himself, his patron, and his father, Buckhurst struck his
      forehead, and rushed out of the room: an insulting laugh followed from
      Colonel Hauton, in which Mr. Sloak and all the company joined&mdash;Buckhurst
      heard it with feelings of powerless desperation. He walked as fast as
      possible&mdash;he almost ran through the barrack-yard and through the
      streets of the town, to get as far as he could from this scene&mdash;from
      these people. He found himself in the open fields, and leaning against a
      tree&mdash;his heart almost bursting&mdash;for still he had a heart: "Oh!
      Mr. Percy!" he exclaimed aloud, "once I had a friend&mdash;a good,
      generous friend&mdash;and I left him for such a wretch as this! Oh! if I
      had followed his advice! He knew me&mdash;knew my better self! And if he
      could see me at this moment, he would pity me. Oh! Caroline! you would
      pity&mdash;no, you would despise me, as I despise myself&mdash;I a
      clergyman!&mdash;Oh! father! father! what have you to answer for!"
    </p>
    <p>
      To this sudden pang of conscience and feeling succeeded the idea of the
      reproaches which his father would pour upon him&mdash;the recollection of
      his debts, and the impossibility of paying them&mdash;his destitute,
      hopeless condition&mdash;anger against the new rector of Chipping-Friars,
      and against his cold, malicious patron, returned with increased force upon
      his mind. The remainder of that day, and the whole of the night, were
      passed in these fluctuations of passion. Whenever he closed his eyes and
      began to doze, he heard the voice of Colonel Hauton drinking the health of
      Mr. Sloak; and twice he started from his sleep, after having collared both
      the rector and his patron. The day brought him no relief: the moment his
      creditors heard the facts, he knew he should be in immediate danger of
      arrest. He hurried to town to his father&mdash;his father must know his
      situation sooner or later, and something must be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      We spare the reader a shocking scene of filial and parental reproaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both, at last, compelled to return to the question, What is to
      be done I The father declared his utter inability to pay his son's debts,
      and told him, that now there remained but one way of extricating himself
      from his difficulties&mdash;to turn to a better patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! sir, I have done with patrons," cried Buckhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, then, will you do, sir? Live in a jail the remainder of your life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst gave a deep sigh, and, after a pause, said, "Well, sir, go on&mdash;Who
      is to be my new patron?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your old friend, Bishop Clay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no claim upon him. He has done much for me already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore he will do more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not pay my debts&mdash;and that is the pressing difficulty. He cannot
      extricate me, unless he could give me a good living immediately, and he
      has none better than the one I have already, except Dr. Leicester's&mdash;his
      deanery, you know, is in the gift of the crown. Besides, the good dean is
      likely to live as long as I shall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay; you do not yet, quick sir, see my scheme&mdash;a scheme which would
      pay your debts and put you at ease at once&mdash;Miss Tammy Clay, the
      bishop's sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An old, ugly, cross, avaricious devil!" cried Buckhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rich! passing rich! and well inclined toward you, Buckhurst, as you
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst said that she was his abhorrence&mdash;that the idea of a man's
      selling himself in marriage was so repugnant to his feelings, that he
      would rather die in a jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father let him exhaust himself in declamation, certain that he would
      be brought to think of it at last, by the necessity to which he was
      reduced. The result was what the commissioner saw it must be. Creditors
      pressed&mdash;a jail in immediate view&mdash;no resource but Miss Tammy
      Clay. He went down to the country to the bishop's, to get out of the way
      of his creditors, and&mdash;to consider about it. He found no difficulty
      likely to arise on the part of the lady. The bishop, old, and almost
      doting, governed by his sister Tammy, who was an admirable housekeeper,
      and kept his table exquisitely, was brought, though very reluctantly, to
      consent to their marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so acquiescent, however, were Miss Tammy's two nephews, French and
      English Clay. They had looked upon her wealth as their indefeasible right
      and property. The possibility of her marrying had for years been, as they
      thought, out of the question; and of all the young men of their
      acquaintance, Buckhurst Falconer was the very last whom they would have
      suspected to have any design upon aunt Tammy&mdash;she had long and often
      been the subject of his ridicule. French Clay, though he had just made an
      imprudent match with a singer, was the more loud and violent against the
      aunt; and English Clay, though he was not in want of her money, was roused
      by the idea of being duped by the Falconers. This was just at the time he
      had commissioned Lady Trant to propose for Miss Georgiana. Aunt Tammy had
      promised to give him six thousand pounds whenever he should marry: he did
      not value her money a single sixpence, but he would not be tricked out of
      his rights by any man or woman breathing. Aunt Tammy, resenting certain
      words that had escaped him derogatory to her youth and beauty, and being
      naturally unwilling to give&mdash;any thing but herself&mdash;refused to
      part with the six thousand pounds. In these hard times, and when she was
      going to marry an expensive husband, she laughing said, that all she had
      would be little enough for her own establishment. Buckhurst would
      willingly have given up the sum in question, but English Clay would not
      receive it as a consequence of his intercession. His pride offended
      Buckhurst: they came to high words, and high silence. English Clay went to
      his relation, Lady Trant, and first reproaching her with having been too
      precipitate in executing his first commission, gave her a second, in which
      he begged she would make no delay: he requested her ladyship would inform
      Mrs. Falconer that a double alliance with her family was more than he had
      looked for&mdash;and in one word, that either her son Buckhurst's marriage
      with his aunt Tammy, or his own marriage with Miss Georgiana, must be
      given up. He would not have his aunt at her age make herself ridiculous,
      and he would not connect himself with a family who could uphold a young
      man in duping an old woman: Lady Trant might shape his message as she
      pleased, but this was to be its substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of Lady Trant's intimation, which of course was made with
      all possible delicacy, Georgiana and Mrs. Falconer wrote to Buckhurst in
      the strongest terms, urging him to give up his intended marriage. There
      were, as they forcibly represented, so many other old women with large
      fortunes who could in the course of a short time be found, who would be
      quite as good matches for him, that it would argue a total insensibility
      to the interests and entreaties of his beloved mother and sister, if he
      persisted in his present preposterous design. Buckhurst answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR MOTHER AND GEORGY,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was married yesterday, and am as sorry for it to-day as you can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "B.F.
    </p>
    <p>
      "P.S.&mdash;There are other young men, with as good fortunes as English
      Clay, in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter and the postscript disappointed and enraged Mrs. Falconer and
      Georgiana beyond description.
    </p>
    <p>
      English Clay left his D.I.O. at Mrs. Falconer's door, and <i>banged</i>
      down to Clay-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgiana, violent in the expression of her disappointment, would have
      exposed herself to Lady Trant, and to half her acquaintance; but Mrs.
      Falconer, in the midst of her mortification, retained command of temper
      sufficient to take thought for the future. She warned Lady Trant to be
      silent, and took precautions to prevent the affair from being known;
      providently determining, that, as soon as her daughter should recover from
      the disappointment of losing Clay-hall, she would marry her to Petcalf,
      and settle her at once at the lodge in Asia Minor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Till Georgiana is married," said she to herself, "the commissioner will
      never let me have peace: if English Clay's breaking off the match gets
      wind, we are undone; for who will think of a rejected girl, beautiful or
      fashionable though she be? So the best thing that can be done is to marry
      her immediately to Petcalf. I will have it so&mdash;and the
      wedding-clothes will not have been bought in vain."
    </p>
    <p>
      The bringing down the young lady's imagination, however, from Clay-hall to
      a lodge was a task of much difficulty; and Mrs. Falconer often in the
      bitterness of her heart exclaimed, that she had the most ungrateful
      children in the world. It seems that it is a tacit compact between mothers
      and daughters of a certain class, that if the young ladies are dressed,
      amused, advertised, and exhibited at every fashionable public place and
      private party, their hearts, or hands at least, are to be absolutely at
      the disposal of their parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just when Mrs. Falconer was exasperated by Georgiana's ingratitude,
      that her son Buckhurst was obliged to come to London after his marriage,
      to settle with his creditors. His bride insisted upon accompanying him,
      and chose this unpropitious time for being introduced to his family. And
      such a bride! Mrs. Buckhurst Falconer! Such an introduction! Such a
      reception! His mother cold and civil, merely from policy to prevent their
      family-quarrels from becoming public; his sisters&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But enough. Here let us turn from the painful scene, and leave this house
      divided against itself.

      CHAPTER XXXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      LETTER FROM ALFRED TO HIS FATHER.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR FATHER,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I send you two pamphlets on the causes of the late changes in the
      ministry, one by a friend, the other by an enemy, of Lord Oldborough.
      Temple, I should have thought the author of the first, but that I know he
      has not time to write, and that there does not appear any of that <i>behind
      the scene knowledge</i> which his situation affords. All the pamphleteers
      and newspaper politicians write as if they knew the whole&mdash;some
      confident that the ministry split on one question&mdash;some on another;
      long declamations and abuse follow as usual on each side, but WISE people,
      and of course myself among that number, suspect 'that all that we know is,
      that we know nothing.' That there was some private intrigue in the
      cabinet, which has not yet transpired, I opine from Temple's reserve
      whenever I have mentioned the subject. This morning, when I asked him to
      frank these pamphlets, he laughed, and said that I was sending coals to
      Newcastle: what this meant he refused to explain, or rather he attempted
      to explain it away, by observing, that people of good understanding often
      could judge better at a distance of what was passing in the political
      world, than those who were close to the scene of action, and subject to
      hear the contradictory reports of the day; therefore, he conceived that I
      might be sending materials for thinking, to one who could judge better
      than I can. I tormented Temple for a quarter of an hour with a
      cross-examination so able, that it was really a pity to waste it out of
      the courts; but I could get nothing more from him. Is it possible, my dear
      father, that you are at the bottom of all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Oldborough certainly told me the other day, and in a very
      significant manner, and, as I now recollect, fixing his inquiring eye upon
      me as he said the words, that he not only felt esteem and regard for Mr.
      Percy, but <i>gratitude</i>&mdash;gratitude for tried friendship. I took
      it at the time as a general expression of kindness; now I recollect the
      look, and the pause after the word gratitude, I put this with Temple's
      coals to Newcastle. But, if it be a secret, I must not inquire, and if it
      be not, you will tell it to me. So I shall go on to my own affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other day I was surprised by a visit at my chambers from an
      East-India director. Lord Oldborough, I find, recommended it to him to
      employ me in a very important cause, long pending, for a vast sum of
      money: the whole, with all its accumulated and accumulating interest,
      depending on a point of law. Heaven send me special sense, or special
      nonsense, sufficient to avoid a nonsuit, of which there have been already
      no less than three in this cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of Lord Oldborough's kindness? This is only one of many
      instances in which I have traced his desire to serve me. It is not common
      with politicians, thus to recollect those who have no means of serving
      them, and who have never reminded them even of their existence by paying
      court in any way actively or passively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Falconers are all discontented with his lordship at this moment,
      because he has disposed of a sinecure place on which the commissioner had
      long had his eye. His lordship has given it to an old disabled
      sea-captain, whom he knew only by reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The accounts you have heard of Buckhurst's marriage are, alas! too true;
      and what you have been told of the lady's age and ugliness is not
      exaggerated. As to her temper and her avarice, I am afraid that what you
      have heard of them is also true; for a brother lawyer of mine, who was
      employed to draw the settlements, says she has taken care to keep every
      penny she could in her own power; and that, in the whole course of his
      practice, he never saw so hard a battle between love and parsimony. Poor
      Buckhurst! who could have foreseen that this would be his fate! I met him
      in the street yesterday with his bride, and he looked as if he would
      rather be hanged than receive my congratulations: I passed without seeming
      to have seen them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just received Mr. Barclay's letter, and am going to work upon his
      settlements. So Caroline's wishes for Lady Mary Pembroke will be
      accomplished. I asked Temple whether Lord Oldborough had heard any thing
      of Count Altenberg since his return to his own country. Yes&mdash;one <i>private</i>
      letter to Lord Oldborough, from which nothing had transpired but one line
      of general thanks for civilities received in England. Temple, who seems to
      have formed the same notion and the same wishes that we had, told me
      yesterday, without my questioning him, that Lord Oldborough had written
      with his own hand an answer to the Count, which none of the secretaries
      have seen. Temple, in sealing up the packet, ventured to ask whether there
      was any chance of seeing Count Altenberg again in England. 'None that he
      knew,' Lord Oldborough answered. Temple, who of all men is least like
      Commissioner Falconer in circumlocutory address, at once blurted out, 'Is
      Count Altenberg going to be married?' Lord Oldborough turned and looked
      upon him with surprise&mdash;whether surprise at his curiosity, or at the
      improbability of the Count's making his lordship the confidant of his
      love-affairs, Temple declares he was in too much confusion to be able to
      decide. Lord Oldborough made no reply, but took up an answer to a
      memorial, which he had ordered Temple to draw, pointed out some unlucky
      mistakes in it, and finished by saying to him, 'Mr. Temple, your thoughts
      are not in your business. <i>Sir, I do believe you are in love</i>;' which
      sentence Temple declares his lordship pronounced with a look and accent
      that would have suited, <i>Sir, I do believe you have the plague</i>.' And
      if so, do me the justice to let me employ Mr. Shaw to do your business,
      till you are married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Temple says that Lord Oldborough is proud of showing himself a foe to
      love, which he considers as the bane of ambition, and as one of the
      weaknesses of human nature, to which a great man ought to be superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whether the secretary be right or wrong in this opinion of his lordship,
      I have not seen enough to be able to determine; and I suspect that Temple
      is not at present a perfectly calm observer. Ever since his visit to the
      country he seems not to be entirely master of himself: his heart is still
      hovering round about some absent object&mdash;what object, I do not know;
      for though he does not deny my charge, he will not tell me the name of his
      fair one. I suspect Lady Frances Arlington of having stolen his heart. I
      am very sorry for it&mdash;for I am clear she is only coquetting with him.
      Temple says that he is too poor to marry. He is so amiable, that I am sure
      he will make any woman he marries happy, if it be not her own fault, and
      if they have but enough to live upon. It grieves me to hear his unavailing
      daily regrets for having quitted the bar. Had he continued in his original
      profession, he might, and in all probability would have been, at this
      moment (as his competitor, a man much his inferior in talent, actually
      is), in the receipt of four thousand good pounds per annum, independent of
      all men; and might have married any woman in any rank. Besides, even with
      such a patron as Lord Oldborough, Temple feels dependence grievous to his
      spirit. He is of a very good family, and was not early used to a
      subservient situation. His health too will be hurt by his close
      confinement to the business of office&mdash;and he has no time for
      indulging his literary taste&mdash;no play for his genius: that was his
      original grievance at the bar, but his present occupations are less
      congenial to his taste than law ever was. His brother-secretary, Mr. Shaw,
      is a mere matter-of-fact man, who is particularly unsuited to him&mdash;an
      objector to every thing new, a curtailer and contemner of all eloquence:
      poor Temple is uneasy and discontented; he would give up his situation
      to-morrow but that he cannot quit Lord Oldborough. He says that he has a
      hundred times resolved to resign&mdash;that he has had his letter written,
      and the words on his lips; but he never could, when it came to the point,
      present the letter, or pronounce the farewell to Lord Oldborough.
      Wonderful the ascendancy this man has over the mind!&mdash;Extraordinary
      his power of attaching, with manners so little conciliatory! Adieu, my
      dear father; I have indulged myself too long in writing to you. I have to
      read over the late Mr. Panton's will, and to give our friend Mr. Gresham
      an opinion upon it&mdash;notwithstanding Rosamond's cruelty to him, he is
      as much our friend, and her friend, as ever. Panton's will is on ten skins
      of parchment: and then I have a plea in rejoinder to draw for Lady Jane
      Granville; and, worse than all, to read and answer four of her ladyship's
      notes now on my table. By-the-bye, I would rather carry on a suit for any
      four men, than for one such woman of business as poor Lady Jane. She is
      never at rest one moment; never can believe that either lawyer or
      solicitor knows what he is about&mdash;always thinks her letters and notes
      can do more than bills in chancery, or than the lord chancellor himself.
      She frets incessantly. I must request Erasmus to medicine her to repose;
      she has absolutely a <i>law fever</i>. Erasmus is at Richmond&mdash;sent
      for by some <i>grandee</i>: he is in high practice. He told me he began
      last week to write to Rosamond, from the bedside of some sleeping patient,
      a full and true answer to all her questions about Miss Panton; but the
      sleeper awakened, and the doctor had never time to finish his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu a second time. Love to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear father, yours affectionately,
    </p>
    <p>
      "ALFRED PERCY.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as I began the second skin of Panton's will, a note was brought to
      me from&mdash;whom do you think? Lord Oldborough, requesting to see me at
      four o'clock. What can his lordship want with me?&mdash;I must send this
      frank before I can satisfy my own curiosity on this point&mdash;or yours,
      Rosamond."
    </p>
    <p>
      After finishing the perusal of Mr. Panton's long-winded will, writing an
      opinion upon it for Mr. Gresham, and penning a quieting note for poor Lady
      Jane Granville, Alfred, eager to be punctual to the appointed hour, went
      to the minister. He need not have looked at his watch so often, or have
      walked so fast, for when he arrived it wanted five minutes of the time
      appointed, and his lordship had not returned from a visit to the Duke of
      Greenwich. He was told, however, that orders had been given for his
      admittance; and he was shown into an apartment where he had leisure,
      during a full quarter of an hour, to admire his own punctuality. At last
      he heard a noise of loud huzzas in the street, and looking out of the
      window, he saw a crowd at the farthest end of the street; and as it moved
      nearer, perceived that the populace had taken the horses from Lord
      Oldborough's carriage, and were drawing him to his own door with loud
      acclamations. His lordship bowed to the multitude as he got out of his
      carriage rather proudly and coldly, yet still the crowd threw up their
      hats and huzzaed. He apologized to Alfred, as he entered the room, for
      having been later than his appointment. Commissioner Falconer and Mr.
      Temple were with him, and the commissioner immediately began to tell how
      they had been delayed by the zeal of the people. Lord Oldborough took a
      paper from his pocket, and walked to the window to read it, without
      seeming to hear one word that the commissioner was saying, and without
      paying any attention to the acclamations of the multitude below, which
      were again repeated on their seeing him at the window. When his lordship
      had finished looking over the paper, he called upon Alfred to witness it,
      and then presenting it to Mr. Falconer, he said, in his haughtiest manner,
      "An equivalent, sir, for that sinecure place which you asked for, and
      which it was out of my power to obtain for you. <i>That</i> was given as
      the just reward of merit, and of public services. My private <i>debts</i>&mdash;"
      [Alfred Percy observed that his lordship did not use the word <i>obligation</i>].
      "My private debts to your family, Mr. Falconer, could not be paid from the
      public fund with which I am entrusted, but you will not, I hope, find me
      the less desirous that they should be properly acknowledged. The annuity,"
      continued he, putting his finger on the amount, which the commissioner
      longed to see, but at which he had not dared yet to look, "the annuity is
      to the full amount of that place which, I think you assured me, would
      satisfy your and Mrs. Falconer's expectations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! my lord, more than satisfy: but from your lordship's private fortune&mdash;from
      your lordship's own emoluments of office, I cannot possibly think&mdash;Mrs.
      Falconer would, I am sure, be excessively distressed&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do me the favour, sir, to let no more be said upon this subject,"
      interrupted Lord Oldborough. "As you return home, will you speak to those
      poor people whom I still hear in the street, and advise them now to return
      peaceably to their homes. My man Rodney, I am afraid, has thought it for
      my honour to be too liberal to these good people&mdash;but you will speak
      to them, commissioner."
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner, who never completely felt Lord Oldborough's character,
      imagined that at this moment his lordship secretly enjoyed the clamour of
      popular applause, and that this cold indifference was affected; Mr.
      Falconer therefore protested, with a smile, that he would do his best to
      calm the enthusiasm of the people, but that it was a hard, if not
      impossible task, to stem the tide of Lord Oldborough's popularity. "Enjoy
      it, my lord!" concluded Mr. Falconer; "Enjoy it!&mdash;No minister in my
      memory ever was so popular!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the commissioner, after saying these words, had left the room,
      Lord Oldborough, in a tone of sovereign contempt, repeated the word,
      "Popularity! There goes a man, now, who thinks me fit to be a fool to
      fame!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Popularity," said Mr. Temple, "is a bad master, but a good servant. A
      great man will," as Burke says, "disdain to veer like the weathercock on
      the temple of fashion with every breath of wind. But may he not, my lord&mdash;say,
      for you know&mdash;may he not wisely take advantage of the gale, and
      direct this great <i>power</i>, so as to work the state-machinery to good
      purpose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dangerous power," replied Lord Oldborough, turning from his secretary
      to Alfred, as if he were impatient to speak of business. Temple, who had
      more of the habits of a man of letters than of a man of business or of a
      courtier, was apt unseasonably to pursue a discussion, and to pique
      himself upon showing sincerity by declaring a difference of opinion from
      his patron. Utterly repugnant as this was to the minister's habits and
      temper, yet in admiration of the boldness of the man, and in consideration
      for his true attachment, Lord Oldborough bore it with magnanimous patience&mdash;when
      he had time&mdash;and when he had not, would cut it short at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a mixed government, popularity, philosophically speaking, if I may
      differ from your lordship&mdash;" Temple began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Permit me, sir, first," interrupted Lord Oldborough, "to settle my
      business with Mr. Alfred Percy, who, being a professional man, and in high
      practice, probably sets a just value upon his time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple, who was a man of quick feelings, felt a word or glance of
      reproof from Lord Oldborough with keen sensibility. Alfred could not fix
      his own attention upon what his lordship was now beginning to say. Lord
      Oldborough saw reflected in Alfred's countenance the disturbance in his
      friend's: and immediately returning, and putting a key into Mr. Temple's
      hand&mdash;"You will do me a service, sir," said he, "by looking over my
      father's papers marked <i>private</i> in red letters. They may be
      necessary in this business&mdash;they are papers which I could trust only
      to one who has my interests at heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple's face brightened instantly, and bowing much lower than usual,
      he received the key with great respect, and hurried away to search for the
      papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a similar reason, Mr. Alfred Percy," said Lord Oldborough, "they
      shall, if you please, be put into your hands." His lordship moved a chair
      towards Alfred, and seated himself. "My law-agent has not satisfied me of
      late. A suit, into which I have been plunged by those who had the
      direction of my business, has not been carried on with ability or vigour.
      I had not leisure to look into any affairs that merely concerned myself.
      Circumstances have just wakened me to the subject, and to the perception
      that my private fortune has suffered, and will suffer yet more materially,
      unless I am fortunate enough to find united in the same person a lawyer
      and a friend. I have looked round and see many older barristers than Mr.
      Alfred Percy, but none so likely to be interested in my affairs as the son
      of my earliest friend, and few more capable of conducting them with
      diligence and ability. May I hope, sir, for hereditary kindness from you,
      as well as for professional services?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No one knew better than Lord Oldborough how to seem receiving whilst he
      conferred a favour; and if ever he appeared harsh, it was only where he
      knew that the people to whom he spoke had not feelings worthy of his
      consideration. His lordship was as much pleased by the manner in which
      this trust was accepted, as our young lawyer could be by the manner in
      which it was offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My papers then shall be sent to you directly," said Lord Oldborough.
      "Look over them, and if you are of opinion that my case is a bad one, I
      will stop where I am. If, on the contrary, you find that justice and law
      are on my side, proceed, persist. I shall trust the whole to you, sir,
      without a farther question."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough next spoke of a steward of his at Clermont-park, who, as
      he had reason to suspect, was leagued with a certain Attorney Sharpe in
      fraudulent designs: his lordship hoped that Mr. Alfred Percy, during his
      vacations, when spent in that neighbourhood, might, consistently with his
      professional duties, find time to see into these affairs; and, in his
      lordship's absence, might supply the want of the master's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred assured his lordship that no effort or care should be wanting on
      his part to justify the high confidence with which he was honoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since you are going to take charge of my business, sir," pursued Lord
      Oldborough, "it is fit you should know my views relative to my affairs. In
      my present situation, with the favour I enjoy, and the opportunities I
      command, it would be easy to make my fortune whatever I pleased. Avarice
      is not my passion. It is my pride not to increase the burdens of my
      country. Mine is a generous country, ever ready to reward her public
      servants, living or dying. But, whilst I live, never will I speculate upon
      her generosity, and, when I die, never shall my heirs appeal to her
      compassion. My power at its zenith, and my character being known, I can
      afford to lay aside much of that adventitious splendour which adds nothing
      to true dignity. Economy and dignity are compatible&mdash;essential to
      each other. To preserve independence, and, consequently, integrity,
      economy is necessary in all stations. Therefore, sir, I determine&mdash;for
      I am not stringing sentences together that are to end in nothing&mdash;I
      determine, at this moment, to begin to make retrenchments in my
      expenditure. The establishment at Clermont-park, whither I have no
      thoughts of returning, may be reduced. I commit that, sir, to your
      discretion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple returned with the papers, on which Lord Oldborough put his
      seal, and said his solicitor should deliver them, with all others that
      were necessary, the next morning to Mr. Percy. Alfred, careful never to
      intrude a moment on the time of the minister, rose, and, without repeating
      his thanks, made his bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I consider this lawsuit as a fortunate circumstance," said Lord
      Oldborough, "since it affords me means at last of engaging Mr. Alfred
      Percy in my service, in a mode which cannot," added his lordship, smiling,
      "interfere with his family horror of ministerial patronage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred said something respectfully expressive of his sense of the
      professional advantage he must derive from being employed by Lord
      Oldborough&mdash;a species of patronage, by which he felt himself most
      highly honoured, and for which he was sure his whole family would feel
      properly grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said Lord Oldborough, following him to the door, "if I had ever
      doubted it, you would convince me that perfect propriety of manner is
      consistent with independence of mind. As to the rest, we all know the
      difference between a client and a patron."
    </p>
    <p>
      The management of Lord Oldborough's business necessarily led to an
      increase of intercourse between his lordship and Alfred, which was
      peculiarly agreeable to our young barrister, not only as it gave him
      opportunities of seeing more of the character of this minister, but as it
      put it into his power to be of service occasionally to his friend Mr.
      Temple. Chained to a desk, his genius confined to the forms of office, and
      with a master too high, and an associate too low, to afford him any of the
      pleasures of society, he had languished for want of a companion. Alfred
      encouraged him by example to submit to the drudgery of business, showed
      him that a man of letters may become a man of business, and that the
      habits of both may be rendered compatible. Temple now performed the duties
      of his office with all that regularity which is supposed to be peculiar to
      dulness. About this time he had been brought into parliament by Lord
      Oldborough, and in the intervals of business, in that leisure which order
      afforded him, he employed and concentrated his powers on a political
      question of considerable importance; and when he was completely master of
      the subject, he rose in the House of Commons, and made a speech, which
      from all parties obtained deserved applause. The speech was published. A
      few days afterwards, Mr. Temple happened to enter Lord Oldborough's
      cabinet earlier than usual: he found his lordship reading; and reading
      with so much attention, that he did not observe him&mdash;he heard his
      lordship's quick and decided pencil mark page after page. At length,
      rising and turning to throw the book on the table, Lord Oldborough saw his
      secretary copying a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An excellent speech&mdash;to the purpose, sir," said Lord Oldborough. "It
      had its effect on the house, I understand; and I thank your friend, Mr.
      Alfred Percy, for putting it into my hands when I had leisure to peruse it
      with attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough thought for some moments, then looked over some official
      papers which he had ordered Mr. Temple to draw up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, sir&mdash;very well. A man of genius, I see, can become a man
      of business."
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship signed the papers, and, when that was finished, turned again
      to Mr. Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, some time ago a place was vacant, which, I know, you had reason to
      expect. It was given to Mr. Shaw, because it was better suited to him than
      to you. The manner in which you took your disappointment showed a
      confidence in my justice. Have you any objection, Mr. Temple, to the
      diplomatic line?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear&mdash;or I should say, I hope&mdash;my lord, that I have not the
      habits of dissimulation, which, as I have always understood, are necessary
      to success in the diplomatic line."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have understood wrongly, sir," replied Lord Oldborough. "I, who have
      seen something of courts, and know something of diplomacy, am of opinion
      that a man of sense, who knows what he is about, who says the thing that
      is, who will tell at once what he can do, and what he cannot, would
      succeed better as a negotiator in the present state of Europe, than could
      any diplomatist with all the simulation and dissimulation of Chesterfield,
      or with the tact of Mazarin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, my lord!" said Mr. Temple, looking up with an air of surprise
      that almost expressed, Then why did you choose Cunningham Falconer for an
      envoy?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray," said Lord Oldborough, taking a long inspiration with a pinch of
      snuff, "pray with that despatch this morning from Mr. Cunningham Falconer
      were there any private letters?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One for Commissioner Falconer, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "None from Count Altenberg to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister took a walk up and down the room, and then returning to Mr.
      Temple, said, "His majesty thinks proper, sir, to appoint you envoy in the
      place of Mr. Cunningham Falconer, who is recalled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, my lord&mdash;his majesty does me great honour," cried Mr.
      Temple, with sudden gratitude: then, his countenance and tone instantly
      changing from joy to sorrow, he added, "His majesty does me great honour,
      my lord, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not great pleasure, it seems, sir," said Lord Oldborough. "I thought,
      Mr. Temple, you had trusted to me the advancement of your fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My fortune! My lord, I am struck with surprise and gratitude by your
      lordship's goodness in taking thought for the advancement of my fortune.
      But I have other feelings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And may I ask what is the nature of your other feelings, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord&mdash;excuse me&mdash;I cannot tell them to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One word more, sir. Do you hesitate, from any motives of delicacy with
      respect to the present envoy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my lord, you look too high for my motive; and the higher I am
      sensible that I stand in your lordship's opinion, the greater is my fear
      of falling. I beg you will excuse me: the offer that your lordship has had
      the goodness to make would be the height of my ambition; but when opposing
      motives draw the will in contrary directions&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, if you are going into the bottomless pit of metaphysics, excuse me,"
      said Lord Oldborough&mdash;"there I must leave you. I protest, sir, you
      are past my comprehension."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And past my own," cried Mr. Temple, "for," with effort he uttered the
      words, "unfortunately I have formed an&mdash;I have become attached to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In short, sir, you are <i>in love</i>, I think," said Lord Oldborough,
      coolly. "I think I told you so, sir, more than a month ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have said it! and said it to Lord Oldborough!" exclaimed Mr. Temple,
      looking as one uncertain whether he were dreaming or awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is undoubtedly uncommon to select a minister of state for the
      confidant of a love affair," said Lord Oldborough, with an air of some
      repressed humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew I should expose myself to your lordship's derision," exclaimed Mr.
      Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too much engrossed by his own feelings, as he pronounced these
      words, to observe in his lordship's countenance an extraordinary emotion.
      It was visible but for one instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a look more placid, and a tone somewhat below his usual voice, Lord
      Oldborough said, "You have misjudged me much, Mr. Temple, if you have
      conceived that your feelings, that such feelings would be matter of
      derision to me. But since you have touched upon this subject, let me give
      you one hint&mdash;Ambition <i>wears</i> better than Love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough sat down to write, and added, "For one fortnight I can
      spare you, Mr. Temple&mdash;Mr. Shaw will undertake your part of the
      business of office. At the end of the ensuing fortnight, I trust you will
      let me have your answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of gratitude, Mr. Temple could express it only by a bow&mdash;and
      retired. The antechamber was now filling fast for the levee. One person
      after another stopped him; all had some pressing business, or some
      business which they thought of consequence, either to the nation or
      themselves.

      "Mr. Temple, I must trouble you to look over these heads of a bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Temple!&mdash;My memorial&mdash;just give me your advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir&mdash;I wrote a letter, three weeks ago, to Lord Oldborough, on the
      herring-fishery, to which I have not had the honour of an answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Temple&mdash;the address from Nottingham&mdash;Where's the reply?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Temple, may I know whether his lordship means to see us gentlemen
      from the city about the loan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir&mdash;Pray, sir!&mdash;My new invention for rifling cannon&mdash;Ordnance
      department!&mdash;Sir, I did apply&mdash;War-office, too, sir!&mdash;It's
      very hard I can't get an answer&mdash;bandied about!&mdash;Sir, I can't
      think myself well used&mdash;Government shall hear more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One word, Mr. Temple, if you please, about tithes. I've an idea&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Temple, don't forget the Littleford turnpike bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Temple, who is to second the motion on Indian affairs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Temple, my good friend, did you speak to Lord Oldborough about my little
      affair for Tom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Temple, a word in your ear&mdash;the member for the borough, <i>you
      know</i>, is dead; letters must be written directly to the corporation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Temple, my dear friend, before you go, give me a frank."
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Mr. Temple got away from memorialists, petitioners, grievances,
      men of business, idle men, newsmen, and dear friends, then hastened to
      Alfred to unburden his mind&mdash;and to rest his exhausted spirits.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The moment that Mr. Temple reached his friend's chambers, he threw himself
      into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What repose&mdash;what leisure&mdash;what retirement is here!" cried he.
      "A man can think and feel a moment for himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not well, I fear, in the midst of the crackling of these parchments,"
      said Alfred, folding up the deeds at which he had been at work. "However,
      I have now done my business for this day, and I am your man for what you
      please&mdash;if you are not engaged by some of your great people, we
      cannot do better than dine together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all my heart," said Mr. Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where shall we dine?" said Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any where you please. But I have a great deal to say to you, Alfred&mdash;don't
      think of dining yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the old work!" cried Alfred.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "'You think of convincing, while I think of dining.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      But, as he spoke, Alfred observed his friend's agitated countenance, and
      immediately becoming serious, he drew a chair beside Mr. Temple, and said,
      "I believe, Temple, you have something to say that you are anxious about.
      You know that if there is any thing I can do, head, hand, and heart are at
      your service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of that I am quite sure, else I should not come here to open my heart to
      you," replied Mr. Temple. Then he related all that had just passed between
      Lord Oldborough and himself, and ended by asking Alfred, whether he
      thought there was any chance of success for his love?
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have not told me who the lady is," said Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have not I?&mdash;but, surely, you can guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have guessed&mdash;but I wish to be mistaken&mdash;Lady Frances
      Arlington?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite mistaken. Guess again&mdash;and nearer home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearer home!&mdash;One of my sisters!&mdash;Not Caroline, I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it must be as I once hoped. But why did you never mention it to me
      before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple declared that he had thought there was so little chance of his
      ever being in circumstances in which he could marry, especially a woman
      who had not some fortune of her own, that he had scarcely ventured to
      avow, even to himself, his attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought my love would wear itself out," added he. "Indeed I did not
      know how serious a business it was, till this sudden proposal was made to
      me of leaving England: then I felt that I should drag, at every step, a
      lengthening chain. In plain prose, I cannot leave England without knowing
      my fate. But don't let me make a fool of myself, Alfred. No man of sense
      will do more than hazard a refusal: that every man ought to do, or he
      sacrifices the dignity of the woman he loves to his own false pride. I
      know that in these days gentlemen-suitors are usually expert in <i>sounding</i>
      the relations of the lady they wish to address. To inquire whether the
      lady is engaged or not is, I think, prudent and honourable: but beyond
      this, I consider it to be treacherous and base to endeavour, by any
      indirect means, to engage relations to say what a lover should learn only
      from the lady herself. Therefore, my dear friend, all I ask is whether you
      have reason to believe that your sister Rosamond's heart is pre-engaged;
      or if you think that there is such a certainty of my being rejected, as
      ought, in common prudence, to prevent my hazarding the mortification of a
      refusal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred assured his friend, that, to the best of his belief, Rosamond's
      heart was disengaged. "And," continued he, "as a witness is or ought to be
      prepared to tell his cause of belief, I will give you mine. Some time
      since I was commissioned by a gentleman, who wished to address her, to
      make the previous inquiry, and the answer was, quite disengaged. Now as
      she did not accept of this gentleman, there is reason to conclude that he
      did not engage her affections&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was he rich or poor, may I ask?" interrupted Mr. Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a leading question," said Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not want you to tell me who the gentleman was&mdash;I know that
      would not be a fair question, and I trust I should be as far from asking,
      as you from answering it. But there are so many rich as well as so many
      poor men in the world, that in answering to the inquiry rich or poor, what
      city or court man do you name? I want only to draw a general inference as
      to your sister's taste for wealth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her taste is assuredly not exclusively for wealth; for her last admirer
      was a gentleman of very large fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am happy, at least, in that respect, in not resembling him," said Mr.
      Temple. "Now for my other question&mdash;what chance for myself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of that, my good friend, you must judge for yourself. By your own rule
      all you have a right to hear is, that I, Rosamond's brother, have no
      reason for believing that she has such a repugnance to you as would make a
      refusal certain. And that you may not too much admire my discretion, I
      must add, that if I had a mind to tell you more, I could not. All I know
      is, that Rosamond, as well as the rest of my family, in their letters
      spoke of you with general approbation, but I do not believe the idea of
      considering you as her lover ever entered into her head or theirs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But now the sooner it enters the better," cried Mr. Temple. "Will you&mdash;can
      you&mdash;Have not you business to do for Lord Oldborough at
      Clermont-park?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;and I am glad of it, as it gives me an opportunity of indulging
      myself in going with you, my dear Temple. I am ready to set out at any
      moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless you! The sooner the better, then. This night in the mail, if
      you please. I'll run and take our places," said he, snatching up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better send," cried Alfred stopping him: "my man can run and take places
      in a coach as well as you. Do you stay with me. We will go to the
      coffee-house, dine, and be ready to set off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple acceded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the mean time," said Alfred, "you have relations and connexions of
      your own who should be consulted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple said he was sure that all his relations and connexions would
      highly approve of an alliance with the Percy family. "But, in fact," added
      he, "that is all they will care about the matter. My relations, though
      high and mighty people, have never been of any service to me: they are too
      grand, and too happy, to mind whether a younger son of a younger son sinks
      or swims; whether I live in single wretchedness or double blessedness. Not
      one relation has nature given, who cares for me half as much as the friend
      I have made for myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely as Alfred was interested for his success, yet he did not let
      this friendship interfere with the justice due to his sister, of leaving
      <i>her</i> sole arbitress of a question which most concerned her
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last stage of their journey, they were lucky enough to have the
      coach to themselves, and Mr. Temple made himself amends for the restraint
      under which he had laboured during the preceding part of the journey,
      whilst he had been oppressed by the presence of men, whose talk was of the
      lower concerns of life. After he had descanted for some time on the
      perfections of his mistress, he ended with expressing his surprise that
      his friend, who had often of late rallied him upon his being in love, had
      not guessed sooner who was the object of his passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred said that the idea of Rosamond had occurred to him, because his
      friend's absence of mind might be dated from the time of his last visit to
      Clermont-park; "but," said Alfred, "as Lady Frances Arlington was there,
      and as I had formerly fancied that her ladyship's wish to captivate or
      dazzle you, had not been quite without effect, I was still in doubt, and
      thought even your praises of Rosamond's disposition and temper, compared
      with her ladyship's, might only be <i>ruse de guerre</i>, or <i>ruse
      d'amour</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was no <i>ruse</i> in the case," said Mr. Temple; "I confess that
      when I first emerged from my obscurity into all the light and life of the
      world of fashion, my eyes were dazzled, and before I recovered the use of
      them sufficiently to compare the splendid objects by which I found myself
      surrounded, I was wonderfully struck with the appearance of Lady Frances
      Arlington, and did not measure, as I ought, the immense difference between
      Lord Oldborough's secretary, and the niece of the Duke of Greenwich. Lady
      Frances, from mere <i>gaieté de coeur</i> likes to break hearts; and she
      continually wishes to add one, however insignificant, to the number of her
      conquests. I, a simple man of literature, unskilled in the wicked ways of
      the fair, was charmed by her ladyship's innocent naïveté and frank gaiety,
      and all that was
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Strangely wild, or madly gay,
  I call'd it only pretty Fanny's way.'
</pre>
    <p>
      "Fortunately, just as I was in imminent danger of exchanging true sighs
      for false smiles, I became acquainted with your sister Rosamond. In the
      country, and under circumstances more favourable for the development of
      character than any which might occur for months or years in a town-life,
      where all the men and women are merely actors, I had leisure to see and
      mark the difference and the resemblance between Lady Frances Arlington's
      character, and that of your sister. They resembled each other in natural
      quickness of intellect and of feeling; in wit, sprightliness, and
      enthusiasm, they were also to a certain degree alike. I was amused by Lady
      Frances Arlington's lively nonsense, till I heard your sister's lively
      sense. Her ladyship hazards saying every thing that occurs to her, and
      often makes happy hits; but your sister's style of wit is far superior,
      and far more agreeable, because it has the grace, elegance, and, above
      all, the infinite variety which literary allusion supplies. I found myself
      pleased, not only with what she said, but with the trains of ideas, that,
      by a single word, she often suggested. Conversing with her, my mind was
      kept always active, without ever being over-exerted or fatigued. I can
      look back, and trace the whole progress of my attachment. I began in this
      way, by finding her conversation most delightful&mdash;but soon discovered
      that she was not only more entertaining and more cultivated, but far more
      amiable than my idol, Lady Frances, because she had never been an idol,
      and did not expect to be adored. Then she was more interesting, because
      more capable of being interested. Lady Frances requires much sympathy, but
      gives little; and for that enthusiasm of temper which had, at first,
      charmed me in her ladyship, I began to lose my taste, when I observed that
      it was always excited by trifles, and by trifles that concerned herself
      more than any one else. I used to think her&mdash;what every body calls
      her, a perfectly natural character; and so, perhaps, she is: but not the
      better for that&mdash;since she is what, I am afraid, we all are naturally&mdash;selfish.
      Her ladyship, if I may use the expression, is enthusiastically selfish.
      Your sister&mdash;enthusiastically generous. Lady Frances's manners are
      caressing, yet I doubt whether she feels affection for any one living,
      except just at the moment when they are ministering to her fancies. It was
      Miss Percy's warm affection for her sister Caroline which first touched my
      heart. I saw each in her own family. The contrast was striking&mdash;in
      short, by the joint effect of contrast and resemblance, my love for one
      lady decreased as fast as it increased for the other; and I had just wit
      and judgment enough to escape from snares that could not have held me
      long, to chains that have power to hold me for ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this history of the birth and progress of his love, Mr. Temple added
      many expressions of his hopes, fears, and regrets, that he had not five
      thousand a year, instead of five hundred, to offer his mistress; he at
      length became absolutely silent. They were within view of the Hills, and
      too many feelings crowded upon his mind to be expressed in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now we might reasonably contrive to fill
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Twelve vast French romances neatly gilt,"
</pre>
    <p>
      with the history of the following eventful fortnight, including the first
      surprise at the arrival of the travellers&mdash;the declaration of Mr.
      Temple's love&mdash;the astonishment of Rosamond on discovering that she
      was the object of this passion&mdash;of a passion so generous and ardent&mdash;the
      consequent and rapid discovery of a hundred perfections in the gentleman
      which had before escaped her penetration&mdash;the strong peculiar
      temptation to marry him, because he had not enough to live upon&mdash;the
      reaction of generosity on the other side of the question, which forbade to
      ruin her lover's fortune&mdash;the fluctuations of sentiment and
      imagination, the delicacies of generosity, gratitude, love, and finally
      the decision of common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate for Rosamond, not only that she had prudent friends, but
      that they had not made her in the least afraid of their superior wisdom,
      so that she had, from the time she was a child, told them every idea, as
      it rose in her vivid imagination, and every feeling of her susceptible
      heart; imprudent as she might appear in her confidential conversation,
      this never passed from words to actions. And now, when she was called upon
      in an important event of life to decide for herself, she acted with
      consummate discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple's character and manners peculiarly pleased her, and his being a
      man of birth and family certainly operated much in his favour. Her parents
      now, as in Mr. Gresham's case, did not suffer their own tastes or
      prepossessions to interfere with her happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline, grateful for the sympathy which Rosamond had always shown her,
      took the warmest interest in this affair. Caroline was the most excellent,
      indulgent, yet safe confidante; and as a hearer, she was absolutely
      indefatigable. Rosamond never found her too busy, too lazy, or too sleepy
      to listen to her: late at night, early in the morning, or in the most
      hurried moment, of the day, it was all the same&mdash;Caroline seemed to
      have nothing to do but to hear, think, and feel for Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fortnight allowed by Lord Oldborough having now nearly elapsed, it was
      absolutely necessary Rosamond should come to some decision. Mr. Temple's
      understanding, temper, disposition, and manners, she allowed to be
      excellent&mdash;his conversation was particularly agreeable. In short,
      after searching in vain for an objection, she was obliged to confess that
      she liked him. Indeed, before she had allowed this in words her mother and
      sister had made the discovery, and had seen the struggle in her mind
      between love and prudence. Mr. Temple's fortune was not sufficient for
      them to live upon, and she knew that a wife in his present circumstances
      must be a burden to him; therefore, notwithstanding all that his passion
      and all that her own partiality could urge, she decidedly refused his
      proposal of an immediate union, nor would she enter into any engagement,
      or suffer him to bind himself by any promise for the future; but he
      obtained permission to correspond with her during his absence from
      England, and with the hope that she was not quite indifferent to him, he
      took leave of her&mdash;returned to town&mdash;waited upon Lord Oldborough&mdash;accepted
      of the embassy, and prepared for his departure to the continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that there was an approaching possibility and probability of hearing
      of Count Altenberg, Caroline felt it extremely difficult to adhere to her
      resolution of never thinking of him, especially as her mind, which had
      been actively occupied and deeply interested in her sister's concerns, was
      now left to return upon itself in all the leisure of retirement.
      Fortunately for her, about this time she was again called upon for that
      sympathy which she was ever ready to give to her friends. She received the
      following letter from Mrs. Hungerford.
    </p>
    <p>
      LETTER FROM MRS. HUNGERFORD TO MISS CAROLINE PERCY.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, my beloved Caroline, my dear young friend, friend of my family, and
      of all who are most near and dear to me&mdash;come, and enjoy with me and
      them that happiness, which your judicious kindness long since foresaw, and
      your prudence promoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My niece, Lady Mary Pembroke, is at last persuaded that she has it in her
      power to make Mr. Barclay permanently happy. He has been obliged to take a
      considerable length of time to convince her of the steadiness of his
      attachment. Indeed, her objection&mdash;that he had been charmed by such a
      coquette as the lady by whom we first saw him captivated, appeared to me
      strong; and I thought my niece right for adhering to it, more especially
      as I believed that at the time her affections pleaded against her reason
      in his favour, and that, if she had been convinced long ago, it would not
      have been against her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Barclay has behaved like a man of sense and honour. Without disguise
      he told her of his former attachment to you. She instantly made an answer,
      which raised her high in my estimation. She replied, that Mr. Barclay's
      being detached from Lady Angelica Headingham by your superior merit was to
      her the strongest argument in his favour. She must, she said, have felt
      insecure in the possession of a heart, which had been transferred directly
      from Lady Angelica to herself, because she was conscious that her own
      disposition was so different from her ladyship's; but in succeeding to the
      affection which he had felt for a woman of your character, she should feel
      perfect security, or at least reasonable hope, that by similar, though
      certainly inferior qualities, she might ensure his happiness and her own.
      They are to be married next week. Lady Mary particularly wishes that you
      should be one of her bride-maids&mdash;come then, my love, and bring all
      my <i>Percys</i>. I shall not perfectly enjoy my own and my niece's
      happiness till you share it with me. My daughter Mortimer insists upon
      signing this as well as myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MARY-ELIZABETH HUNGERFORD.
    </p>
    <p>
      "KATE MORTIMER."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline and <i>all Mrs. Hungerford's Percys</i> obeyed her summons with
      alacrity. Lady Mary Pembroke's marriage with Mr. Barclay was solemnized
      under the happiest auspices, and in the midst of approving and
      sympathizing friends. As soon as the ceremony was over, and she had
      embraced and congratulated her niece, Mrs. Hungerford turned to Mrs.
      Percy, and in a low voice said, "If it were not too much for one so happy
      as I am, so rich in blessings, to ask one blessing more, I should ask to
      be permitted to live to see the day when our dear Caroline&mdash;" Mrs.
      Hungerford pressed Mrs. Percy's hand, but could say no more; the tears
      rolled down her cheeks as she looked up to heaven. Some minutes
      afterwards, following Caroline with her eyes, "Look at her, Mrs. Percy!"
      said Mrs. Hungerford. "Did ever selfish coquette, in the height of triumph
      over lover or rival, enjoy such pleasure as you see sparkling at this
      moment in that dear girl's countenance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride and bridegroom set off immediately for Mr. Barclay's seat in
      Berkshire. Lady Florence accompanied her sister; and Mrs. Hungerford,
      after parting from both her nieces, entreated that Caroline might be left
      with her. "It is a selfish request, I know, my dear; but at my age I
      cannot afford to be generous of the society of those I love. Allow me to
      plead my age, and my&mdash;Well, I will not say more since I see it gives
      you pain, and since I see you will grant the prayer of my petition, rather
      than hear my claims to your compassion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline liked particularly to stay with Mrs. Hungerford at this time,
      when there was not any company at the castle, no one but Mrs. Hungerford
      and her daughter, so that she had the full and quiet enjoyment of their
      society. At this time of her life, and in the state of her mind at this
      period, no society could have been more agreeable, soothing, and useful to
      Caroline, than that of such a friend. One, who had not forgotten the
      passions of youth; who could give at once sympathy and counsel; who was
      willing to allow to love its full and exquisite power to exalt the
      happiness of human life, yet appeared herself, in advanced and serene old
      age, a constant example of the falsehood of the notion, that the
      enthusiasm of passion is essential to felicity. An elegant and just
      distinction has been made by a philosophical writer between <i>delicacy of
      passion</i> and <i>delicacy of taste</i>. One leading to that ill-governed
      susceptibility, which transports the soul to ecstasy, or reduces it to
      despair, on every adverse or prosperous change of fortune; the other
      enlarging our sphere of happiness, by directing and increasing our
      sensibility to objects of which we may command the enjoyment, instead of
      wasting it upon those over which we have no control. Mrs. Hungerford was a
      striking example of the advantage of cultivating <i>delicacy of taste</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At an advanced age, she showed exquisite perception of pleasure in every
      work of genius; in conversation, no stroke of wit or humour escaped her
      quick intelligence, no shade of sentiment or politeness was lost upon her;
      and on hearing of any trait of generosity or greatness of soul, her whole
      countenance beamed with delight; yet with all this quickness of feeling
      she was quite free from fastidiousness, and from that irritability about
      trifles, into which those who indulge <i>the delicacy of passion</i> in
      youth are apt to degenerate in age. Caroline felt, every day, increasing
      affection as well as admiration for Mrs. Hungerford, and found time pass
      delightfully in her company. Besides that general and well-chosen
      acquaintance with literature which supplied her with perpetual resources,
      she had that knowledge of life and of the world which mixes so well, in
      conversation, with the knowledge of books. She had known, intimately, most
      of the celebrated people of the last century, and had store of curious and
      interesting anecdotes, which she produced with so much taste and judgment,
      and told so well, as never to fatigue attention. Caroline found that her
      mind was never passive or dormant in Mrs. Hungerford's company; she was
      always excited to follow some train of thought, to discuss some
      interesting question, or to reflect upon some new idea. There was,
      besides, in the whole tenor of her conversation and remarks such an
      indulgence for human nature, with all its faults and follies, as left the
      most pleasing and encouraging impression on the mind, and inspired hope
      and confidence. Her anecdotes and her philosophy all tended to prove that
      there is more virtue than vice, more happiness than misery, in life; and,
      above all, that there is a greater probability that the world should
      improve than that it should degenerate. Caroline felt pleased continually
      to find her own favourite opinions and hopes supported and confirmed by
      the experience and judgment of such a woman; and there was something
      gratifying to her, in being thus distinguished and preferred by one who
      had read so much and thought so deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Hungerford had heard nothing more of Count Altenberg, she wisely
      forbore to touch upon the subject, or even to mention his name to
      Caroline; and she saw, with satisfaction, the care with which her young
      friend turned her mind from every dangerous recollection. Sometimes,
      however, the remembrance of the Count was unavoidably recalled; once, in
      particular, in turning over the life of Sir Philip Sidney, there was a
      passage copied in his hand, on a slip of paper, which had accidentally
      been left in the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Algernon Sidney, in a letter to his son, says, that in the whole of his
      life he never knew one man, of what condition soever, arrive at any degree
      of reputation in the world, who made choice of, or delighted in the
      company or conversation of those, who in their qualities were inferior, or
      in their parts not much superior to himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you there, my love? Something that pleases and interests you
      particularly, I see," said Mrs. Hungerford, not knowing what it was that
      Caroline was reading: "show it me, my dear&mdash;I am sure I shall like
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline, deeply blushing, gave her the paper. She recollected the
      hand-writing, and folding up the paper, put it in her pocket-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is an observation," said she, "that I wish I could write in letters of
      gold for the advantage of all the young men in the world in whom I take
      any interest."
    </p>
    <p>
      The energetic warmth with which Mrs. Hungerford spoke relieved Caroline,
      as it seemed to justify the delight she had involuntarily expressed&mdash;the
      sentiments for the individual seemed now enveloped in general approbation
      and benevolence. She never loved Mrs. Hungerford better than at this
      instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hungerford observed that none of the common sentimental passages,
      either in poetry or novels, ever seemed to affect Caroline; and to the
      romantic descriptions of love she was so indifferent that it might have
      appeared to a common observer as if she was, and ever would be, a stranger
      to the passion. By the help of the active and plastic powers of the
      imagination, any and every hero of a novel could be made, at pleasure, to
      appear the exact resemblance of each lady's different lover. Some, indeed,
      professed a peculiar and absolute exclusive attachment, founded on
      unintelligible or indescribable merits or graces; but these ladies, of all
      others, she had found were most liable to change, and on farther
      acquaintance with the world to discover, on generalizing their notions,
      similar or superior attractions in new models of perfection. In Caroline,
      Mrs. Hungerford saw none of these capricious fancies, and that it was not
      her imagination, but her reason which gave Count Altenberg the exalted
      place he held in her esteem. It was therefore with pleasure, that this
      kind lady perceived, that her young friend's residence with her soothed
      her mind and restored it to its former tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Caroline was soon obliged to leave Hungerford Castle, A letter from
      Erasmus informed her that poor Lady Jane Granville was ill of a nervous
      fever, that she had no companion, no one to attend her but a maid-servant,
      and that she was much in want of some judicious friend who could raise her
      spirits and tranquillize her mind, which was in a state of continual
      agitation about her lawsuit. Caroline, remembering Lady Jane's former
      kindness, thought this a fit opportunity to show her gratitude; and, happy
      as she was with her friends at Hungerford Castle, she hesitated not a
      moment to sacrifice her own pleasure.&mdash;Her father and mother approved
      of her determination, and her brother Alfred carried her to London.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In these days, people travel with so much safety, ease, and celerity, that
      heroines have little chance of adventures on the road; and a journey is
      now so common a thing, that, as Rosamond observed, the most brilliant
      imagination has no hope of having wonders to relate. To Rosamond's
      mortification, Caroline and her brother reached London without any event
      having occurred better worth recording than the loss of an umbrella. They
      drove into town when it was nearly dark, just before the lamps were
      lighted; Caroline, therefore, had little satisfaction from the first view
      of the metropolis. She found Lady Jane Granville in a small lodging in
      Clarges-street&mdash;the room dark&mdash;a smell of smoke&mdash;the
      tea-equipage prepared&mdash;Lady Jane lying on a shabby-looking sofa&mdash;drops
      and a smelling-bottle on a little table beside her. She raised herself as
      Caroline entered, looked half pleased, half ashamed to see her; and,
      stretching out her hand, said, in a complaining voice, "Ah! my dear
      Caroline, are you really come? This is too good! Sadly changed, you find&mdash;and
      every thing about me&mdash;Sit down, my dear&mdash;Keppel, do let us have
      tea as soon as you can," said Lady Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soon as ever Eustace comes in, my lady," answered Keppel, peevishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the mean time, for Heaven's sake, allow us a little more light&mdash;I
      cannot live without light. Come nearer to me, my dear Caroline, and tell
      me how did you leave all our friends at the Hills?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Caroline was answering her ladyship, more candles were brought, and
      Lady Jane moved them on the table till she threw the light full on
      Caroline's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Handsomer than ever! And altogether so <i>formed</i>. One would not
      think, Alfred, she had been buried all this time in the country. Ah!
      perverse child; why would not you come when I could have been of some use
      to you&mdash;when, at least, I could, have received you as I ought? This
      is not a fit place, you see; nor am I now in circumstances, or in a style
      of life&mdash;Heigho!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Percy is not come yet," resumed she. "This is his usual hour&mdash;and
      I wrote a note to tell him that he would meet his sister Caroline
      to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      In all her ladyship said, in every look and motion, there was the same
      nervous hurry and uneasiness. Dr. Percy arrived, and for a moment Lady
      Jane forgot herself in sympathy with the pleasure the brother and sister
      showed at meeting. Soon, however, she would have relapsed into melancholy
      comparisons, but, that Dr. Percy checked the course of her thoughts; and
      with the happy art, by which a physician of conversational powers can
      amuse a nervous patient, he, without the aid of poppy or mandragora,
      medicined her to rest, though not to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Erasmus was alone with his sister, he observed that no permanent
      amendment could be expected in Lady Jane's health till her mind should be
      at ease about her lawsuit. While this was undecided, her imagination
      vacillated between the horror of neglected poverty, and the hopes of
      recovering her former splendour and consideration. The lawsuit was not to
      be decided for some weeks, and Caroline saw that all that could be done in
      the mean time was as much as possible to soothe and amuse her patient:
      however tiresome and difficult the task, she went through it with the
      utmost cheerfulness and sweetness of temper. Day after day she passed
      alone with Lady Jane, hearing her complaints, bodily and mental, and
      listening to the eternally repeated history of her lawsuit. But Caroline's
      patience was ensured by a sense of gratitude, which, in her, was not a
      sentimental phrase, but a motive for long endurance, still more difficult
      than active exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      One half hour in the day, however, she was sure of being happy&mdash;the
      half hour when her brother Erasmus paid his visit. Of Alfred she saw
      little, for he was so much engaged with business, that a few minutes now
      and then were all he could possibly spare from his professional duties.
      Mr. Temple called. She was surprised to see him, for she thought he had
      been on his way to the continent; but he told her that difficulties had
      occurred, chiefly through the manoeuvres of Cunningham Falconer, and that
      he did not know when there would be an end of these&mdash;that Lord
      Oldborough was glad of the delay at present, because he wanted Mr.
      Temple's assistance, as the other secretary had been taken ill, and his
      lordship had not yet fixed upon a confidential person to supply his place.
      Of course, in these circumstances, Mr. Temple was so much occupied, that
      Caroline saw very little of him; and she experienced what thousands have
      observed, that, however people may wish to meet in great towns, it is
      frequently impracticable, from small difficulties as to time, distance,
      and connexions. Of Mr. Gresham, Caroline had hoped that she should see a
      great deal&mdash;her brother Erasmus had long since introduced him to Lady
      Jane Granville; and, notwithstanding his being a merchant, her ladyship
      liked him. He was as much disposed as ever to be friendly to the whole
      Percy family; and the moment he heard of Caroline's being in town, he
      hastened to see her, and showed all his former affectionate regard in his
      countenance and manner. But his time and his thoughts were now engrossed
      by an affair very near his heart, which he was impatient to bring to a
      termination. As soon as this should be accomplished, he was to set out for
      Amsterdam, where the concerns of his late partner, old Mr. Panton, as his
      correspondents wrote, imperiously demanded his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This affair, which was so near Mr. Gresham's heart, related to his dear
      Constance. Alfred had alluded to it in one of his letters, and Erasmus had
      begun to write the particulars to Rosamond; but he had not at the time
      leisure to finish the letter, and afterwards burnt it, being uncertain how
      the romance, as Alfred called it, might end. He therefore thought it
      prudent to say nothing about it. The whole story was now told to Caroline,
      and, briefly, was this.
    </p>
    <p>
      After old Panton's rage against Dr. Percy, in consequence of the suspicion
      that his daughter was in love with him; after the strange wig-scene, and
      the high words that followed, had driven Erasmus from the house, Constance
      went to her father, and, intent upon doing justice to Erasmus, at whatever
      hazard to herself, protested that he had not been the cause of her refusal
      of Lord Roadster. To convince her father of this, she confessed that her
      heart was not entirely disengaged&mdash;no threats, no persuasion, could,
      however, draw from her the name of the person whom she preferred: she knew
      that to name him would be only to ruin his fortune&mdash;that her father
      never would consent to her marrying him; nor had the object of her
      preference ever given her reason to think that he felt any thing more for
      her than regard and respect. Old Panton, the last man in the world to
      understand any delicacies, thought her whole confession "<i>nonsense</i>:"
      the agitation and hesitation with which it was made, and her eagerness to
      clear Dr. Percy's credit, and to reinstate him in her father's favour,
      conspired to convince the old man that his "own first original opinion was
      right." Of this, indeed, he seldom needed any additional circumstances to
      complete the conviction on any occasion. During the remainder of his life
      he continued obstinate in his error: "If she likes any body else, why
      can't the girl name him? Nonsense&mdash;that cursed Dr. Percy is the man,
      and he never shall be the man." In this belief old Panton died, and what
      is of much more consequence, in this belief he made his will. On purpose
      to exclude Dr. Percy, and in the hope of accomplishing his favourite
      purpose of ennobling his descendants, he, in due legal form, inserted a
      clause in his will, stating, "that he bequeathed his whole fortune (save
      his wife's dower) to his beloved daughter, upon condition, that within the
      twelve calendar months next ensuing, after his decease, she, the said
      Constance, should marry a man not below the rank of the son of a baron.
      But in case she, the said Constance, should not marry within the said
      twelve calendar months, or should marry any man below the rank of a baron,
      then and after the expiration of said twelve calendar months, the said
      fortune to go to his beloved wife, except an annuity of two hundred pounds
      a year, to be paid thereout to his daughter Constance." Mr. Gresham was
      appointed sole executor to his will. As soon as it was decently possible,
      after old Panton's decease, Lord Roadster renewed his suit to Constance,
      and was civilly but very steadily refused. Many other suitors, coming
      within the description of persons favoured by the will, presented
      themselves, but without success. Some making their application to
      Constance herself, some endeavouring to win her favour through the
      intercession of her guardian, Mr. Gresham&mdash;all in vain. Month after
      month had passed away, and Mr. Gresham began to be much in dread, and Mrs.
      Panton, the step-mother, somewhat in hopes, that the twelve calendar
      months would elapse without the young lady's having fulfilled the terms
      prescribed by the will. Mr. Gresham, one morning, took his fair ward
      apart, and began to talk to her seriously upon the subject. He told her
      that he thought it impossible she should act from mere perverseness or
      caprice, especially as, from her childhood upwards, he had never seen in
      her any symptoms of an obstinate or capricious disposition; therefore he
      was well convinced that she had some good reason for refusing so many
      offers seemingly unexceptionable: he was grieved to find that he had not
      sufficiently won or deserved her confidence, to be trusted with the secret
      of her heart. Constance, who revered and loved him with the most grateful
      tenderness, knelt before him; and clasping his hand in hers, while tears
      Tolled over her blushing cheeks, endeavoured to speak, but could not for
      some moments. At last, she assured him that delicacy, and the uncertainty
      in which she was whether she was beloved, were the only causes which had
      hitherto prevented her from speaking on this subject, even to him, who now
      stood in the place of her father, and who had ever treated her with more
      than a father's kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gresham named Erasmus Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Henry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How was it possible that Mr. Gresham had never thought of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gresham had thought of him&mdash;had suspected that Mr. Henry's love
      for Constance had been the cause of his quitting England&mdash;had admired
      the young man's honourable silence and resolution&mdash;had recalled him
      from Amsterdam, and he was now in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      But young Henry, who knew nothing of Mr. Gresham's favourable disposition
      towards him, who had only commercial correspondence with him, and knew
      little of his character, considered him merely as the executor of Mr.
      Panton, and, with this idea, obeyed his summons home to settle accounts.
      When they met, he was much surprised by Mr. Gresham's speaking, not of
      accounts, but of Constance. When Mr. Gresham told him the terms of Mr.
      Panton's will, far from appearing disappointed or dejected, Mr. Henry's
      face flushed with hope and joy. He instantly confessed to her guardian
      that he loved Constance passionately; and that now, when it could not be
      supposed he had mercenary views; now, when no duty, no honour forbad him,
      he would try his fate. He spoke with a spirit given by strong passion long
      repressed, and with a decision of character which his modesty and reserve
      of manner had, till now, prevented from appearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he consider," Mr. Gresham asked, "what he expected Miss Panton to
      sacrifice for him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, fortune, not duty&mdash;duty he could never have asked her to
      sacrifice; he could not have esteemed her if she <i>had</i> sacrificed
      duty. As to the rest," added he, proudly, "Miss Panton is now to decide
      between love and fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This from the modest Mr. Henry! from whom, till this moment, I never
      heard a syllable that savoured of presumption!" said Mr. Gresham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Henry was silent&mdash;and stood with an air of proud determination.
      Regardless of the surprise and attention with which Mr. Gresham considered
      him during this silence, he thought for a few moments, and asked, "Sir,
      when may I see Miss Panton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And would you," said Mr. Gresham, "if it were in your power, sir, reduce
      the woman you love from opulence to poverty&mdash;to distress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have four hundred a year, Miss Panton has two&mdash;six hundred a year
      is not poverty, sir. Distress&mdash;the woman I marry shall never know
      whilst I have life and health. No, sir, this is not romance. Of my
      perseverance in whatever I undertake, even when least congenial to my
      habits, you have had proofs. Mr. Gresham, if Miss Panton approves of me,
      and if love can make her happy, I fear not to assert to you, her guardian,
      that I will make her happy. If she love me not, or," added he, his whole
      countenance changing from the expression of ardent love to that of cold
      disdain, "or, if love be not in her mind superior to fortune, then I have
      little to regret. Wealth and honours wait her command. But," resumed he,
      "the trial I will make&mdash;the hazard I will run. If I am mistaken&mdash;if
      I am presumptuous&mdash;the humiliation be mine&mdash;the agony all my
      own: my heart will bear it&mdash;or&mdash;break!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heroics!" said Mr. Gresham. "Now let me ask&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me ask, sir&mdash;pardon me," interrupted Mr. Henry&mdash;"Let me beg
      to see Miss Panton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, listen to me, young man&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young gentleman, sir, if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young gentleman, sir, if you please," repeated Mr. Gresham, mildly; "I
      can make allowance for all this&mdash;you were bred a soldier, jealous of
      honour&mdash;but listen to me: there is one thing I must tell you before
      you see Miss Panton&mdash;though I apprehend it may somewhat mortify you,
      as it will interfere with your boast of disinterestedness and your vow of
      poverty&mdash;Miss Panton I have from her cradle been in the habit of
      considering partly as my own&mdash;my own child&mdash;and, as such, I have
      left her in my will ten thousand pounds. As she will want this money
      before my death, if she marries you, I must convert my legacy into a
      marriage-portion, and you shall not, sir, have love without fortune,
      whatever your heroics may think of it. Now go to your mistress, and keep
      my secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Henry was evidently more touched by this generosity than by this
      bounty; and with a gentleness and humility the most feeling he said, "How
      shall I thank you, sir, for bearing with me as you did?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Mr. Gresham, "old as I am, I know what it is to be in love, and
      can conceive too what it is to fear that a guardian might be cross, and
      that the executor and the partner of Mr. Panton might act like Mr. Panton
      himself. Say no more&mdash;I understand it all, you see&mdash;Go to your
      Constance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the haughtiness and spirit this young man had shown, Mr. Gresham
      saw the sincerity, strength, and disinterestedness of his affection; and
      in Mr. Gresham's estimation these were no trifling merits. We pass over&mdash;shall
      we be forgiven?&mdash;the love scenes between Mr. Henry and Constance. In
      these cases it is well when there is some sober friend to look to the
      common sense of the thing, and in the midst of the exaltation to do the
      necessary business of life. Mr. Gresham laid Mr. Panton's will before
      counsel learned in the law, took opinions from two different counsel; from
      Alfred Percy, whose friendship was likely to quicken his attention, and
      from another barrister of long standing, who, being totally unconnected
      with the parties might probably give a perfectly unbiassed and
      dispassionate advice. Both agreed that there was no avoiding the clause in
      the will; that Miss Panton, if she married a man below the rank of a
      baron's son, must give up her fortune to her step-mother at the end of
      twelve calendar months from the time of her father's decease; but both
      barristers gave it as their opinion, that the income during those twelve
      months belonged to Constance: this was a considerable sum, which, by Mr.
      Gresham's advice, was to be vested with the rest of Mr. Henry's capital in
      the firm of the house of Panton and Co. In consequence of Mr. Gresham's
      earnest recommendation, and of his own excellent conduct and ability, Mr.
      Henry was from this time joined in the firm, and as one of the partners
      had a secure income proportioned to his part of the capital, besides a
      share in the very advantageous speculations in which the house was
      engaged. Mr. Gresham undertook to supply Mr. Henry's place at Amsterdam,
      whither he was under the necessity of going. His house he would leave to
      Constance during his absence. She had best begin by taking possession of
      it, and establish herself there, he observed, that she might not have the
      inconvenience and mortification of being turned out of her own at the end
      of the year. "And if," said he, "I should be able, when I return, to make
      Mr. Henry's residence with me agreeable to him, I shall hope he will not,
      while I live, take my Constance quite away from me&mdash;I look to her as
      my chief happiness in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Rosamond had heard the sigh which closed this speech, and if she had
      seen the simplicity and delicacy of Mr. Gresham's generosity on this
      occasion, she would have reproached herself for refusing him, and would
      almost have reasoned herself into the belief that she had done very wrong
      not to marry him; but this belief would only, <i>could</i> only, have
      lasted till she should see Mr. Temple again: so that, upon the whole, it
      was best for poor Mr. Gresham that she knew nothing of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      All things being arranged thus in the kindest and most convenient manner
      by this excellent man, and the day being fixed for the marriage of
      Constance and Mr. Henry, Caroline was asked to be bride's-maid, and the
      honour of Lady Jane Granville's company was requested. It is inconceivable
      how much importance Lady Jane attached to the idea of her accepting or
      refusing this request, and the quantity she talked about it was wonderful!
      Notwithstanding the habitual theme of her being of no consequence now to
      any one, of her being utterly forgotten and out of the world, yet she had
      still a secret, very secret belief, that all she did would be known and
      commented upon; and she worked herself up to think, also, that the honour
      to be conferred, or the offence that would be taken in consequence of her
      decision, would be immortal. Every five minutes for two hours after the
      first reading of Mr. Gresham's note, she took it up, laid it down, and
      argued the matter pro and con to Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long and loud knocking at the door came to Caroline's relief: it was
      repeated with imperious impatience. "Who is it, my dear? look out of the
      window, but don't let yourself be seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline did not know any of the fashionable equipages, which to Lady Jane
      appeared a great defect in her education: upon this occasion, however, she
      thought she recollected the livery to be Mrs. Falconer's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! no, my dear, quite impossible&mdash;the Falconers have not been near
      me this age. I will tell you whose livery it is&mdash;there is a
      resemblance, but it is astonishing to me a girl of your sense cannot learn
      the difference&mdash;it is old Lady Brangle's livery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might very possibly be so," Caroline allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant however brought in cards and a note from Mrs. Falconer&mdash;the
      note was to announce to Lady Jane Granville the approaching marriage of
      Miss Falconer with Sir Robert Percy&mdash;the day was named, and the
      honour of Lady Jane Granville's company was requested at the wedding. Lady
      Jane knew that this communication was made, not in the least in the
      kindness, but in the pride of Mrs. Falconer's heart; and precisely in the
      same spirit in which it was written Lady Jane thought it incumbent upon
      her to receive and answer it. Her ladyship was really warm and honest in
      her friendships, and very grateful to <i>her branch</i> of the Percy
      family, for the kindness they had shown her in adversity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it extremely ill-judged and ill-bred of Mrs. Falconer to invite
      me to this wedding. Does she think I have no feeling? My own near
      relations and best friends deprived of their birth-right by this Sir
      Robert Percy&mdash;does she conceive it possible that I <i>could</i> go to
      such a wedding?&mdash;No; nor did she wish or expect it; she only wrote
      from vanity, and I shall answer her with pride, which, at least, is
      somewhat superior to that mean passion; and I shall go, I am now
      determined, to Mr. Gresham's&mdash;I do nothing by halves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship immediately wrote answers to both the invitations. Nothing
      for months had done her so much good as the exertion, interest, and
      imaginary self-importance these two notes created. At Mr. Gresham's on the
      day of the wedding her ladyship appeared with great dignity, and was
      satisfied that she had conferred honour and serious obligation. Could she
      have seen into the minds of all the company, she would have been
      astonished to find how little she occupied their thoughts. It would be
      difficult to determine whether it is more for the happiness or misery of
      man and womankind that politeness should cherish, or truth destroy, these
      little delusions of self-love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently there appeared in the newspapers a splendid account of the
      marriage at St. George's church, Hanover-square, of Sir Robert Percy, of
      Percy-hall, with Arabella, the eldest daughter of J. Falconer, Esquire:
      present at the ceremony was a long list of <i>fashionable friends</i>,
      who, as Lady Jane Granville observed, "would not have cared if the bride
      had been hanged the next minute." The happy pair, after partaking of an
      elegant collation, set out in a barouche and four for Percy-hall, the seat
      of Sir Robert Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So!" cried Lady Jane, throwing down the paper, "Mrs. Falconer has
      accomplished that match at last, and has got one of her daughters well off
      her hands&mdash;the ugly one too. Upon my word, she is amazingly clever.
      But, after all, the man has a horrid temper, and a very bad character. Now
      it is over, my dear Caroline, I must tell you, that long ago, before I was
      so well aware of what sort of a man he was, I had formed the plan of
      marrying him to you, and so uniting the two branches, and bringing the
      estate into your family; but we have often reason to rejoice that our
      best-concerted schemes don't succeed. I give Mrs. Falconer joy. For worlds
      I would not have such a man married to any relation or friend of mine&mdash;Oh!
      if I recover my fortune, Caroline, I have hopes for you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship was interrupted by the arrival of Mr. Gresham, who came to
      take leave, as he was just setting out for Holland. He was a man who said
      less and did more for his friends, as Caroline observed, than almost any
      person she knew. On seeing his gallery of paintings, she had noticed some
      beautiful miniatures; he now brought all those which she had admired, and
      begged to leave them with her during his absence, that she might at her
      leisure copy any of them she liked. He knew she painted in miniature, for
      he had long ago, when at the Hills, seen her copy of M. de Tourville's
      picture of Euphrosyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If," said Mr. Gresham, observing that Caroline scrupled to take charge of
      so many precious pictures, "if you are too proud to receive from me the
      slightest kindness without a return, I am willing to put myself under an
      obligation to you. While I am away, at your leisure, make me a copy of
      that Euphrosyne&mdash;I shall love it for your sake, and as reminding me
      of the time when I first saw it&mdash;the happiest time perhaps of my
      life," added he, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Rosamond!" thought Caroline, "if you had heard that!&mdash;and if you
      knew how generously kind he has been to your brothers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At parting from Alfred and Erasmus, he said to them, "My good young
      friends, why don't either of you marry? To be sure, you are young enough;
      but think of it in time, and don't put off, put off, till you grow into
      old bachelors. I know young men generally in these days say, they find it
      too expensive to marry&mdash;some truth in that, but more selfishness:
      here's young Mr. Henry has set you a good example. Your practice in your
      professions, I suppose, puts you as much at ease in the world by this time
      as he is. Malthus, you know, whom I saw you studying the other day,
      objects only to people marrying before they can maintain a family. Alfred,
      when I was at the Hills, I heard of a certain Miss Leicester. If you shall
      think of marrying before I come back again, you'll want a house, and I've
      lent mine already&mdash;but money, you know, can place one in any part of
      the town you might like better&mdash;I have a sum lying idle at my
      bankers, which I have just had transferred to the account of Alfred and
      Erasmus Percy&mdash;whichever of you marry before I come back, must do me
      the favour to purchase a good house&mdash;I must have it at the polite end
      of the town, or I shall be worse than an old bachelor&mdash;let me find it
      well furnished and aired&mdash;nothing airs a house so well as a warm
      friend: then, you know, if I should not fancy your purchase, I leave it on
      your hands, and you pay me the purchase-money year by year, at your
      leisure&mdash;if you can trust that I will not throw you into jail for
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The warmth of Alfred's thanks in particular showed Mr. Gresham that he had
      not been mistaken about Miss Leicester.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I had thought, or rather I wish I had spoken of this sooner,"
      added Mr. Gresham: "perhaps I might have had the pleasure of seeing you
      married before my leaving England; but&mdash;no&mdash;it is best as it is&mdash;I
      might have hurried things&mdash;and in these matters every body likes to
      go their own pace, and their own way. So fare ye well&mdash;God bless you
      both, and give you good wives&mdash;I can ask nothing better for you from
      Heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      No man could he more disposed than Alfred felt himself at this instant to
      agree with Mr. Gresham, and to marry immediately&mdash;visions of beauty
      and happiness floated before his imagination; but a solicitor knocking at
      the door of his chambers recalled him to the sense of the sad necessity of
      finishing some law-papers instead of going into the country to see his
      fair mistress. His professional duty absolutely required his remaining in
      town the whole of this term&mdash;Lady Jane Granville's business, in
      particular, depended upon him&mdash;he gave his mind to it. She little
      knew how difficult it was to him at this time to fix his attention, or how
      much temper it required in these circumstances to bear with her
      impatience. The week before her cause was expected to come to trial, her
      ladyship's law-fever was at its height&mdash;Alfred avoided her presence,
      and did her business.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day arrived&mdash;her cause came on&mdash;Alfred's exertions proved
      successful&mdash;and hot from the courts he brought the first joyful news&mdash;a
      decree in her favour!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane started up, clasped her hands, embraced Alfred, embraced
      Caroline, returned thanks to Heaven&mdash;again and again, in broken
      sentences, tried to express her gratitude. A flood of tears came to her
      relief. "Oh! Alfred, what pleasure your generous heart must feel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      From this day&mdash;from this hour, Lady Jane's health rapidly recovered;
      and, as Erasmus observed, her lawyer had at last proved her best
      physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Caroline saw Lady Jane restored to her strength, and in excellent
      spirits, preparing to take possession of a handsome house in
      Spring-Gardens, she thought she might be spared to return to her own
      family. But Lady Jane would not part with her; she insisted upon keeping
      her the remainder of the winter, promising to carry her back to the Hills
      in a few weeks. It was plain that refusing this request would renew the
      ire of Lady Jane, and render irreconcilable the quarrel between her
      ladyship and the Percy family. Caroline felt extremely unwilling to offend
      one whom she had obliged, and one who really showed such anxiety for her
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, my dear Lady Jane," said she, smiling, "that if I stay with you,
      you will form a hundred kind schemes for my establishment; but forgive me
      when I tell you, that it is upon the strength of my belief in the
      probability that they will none of them be accomplished, that I consent to
      accept your ladyship's invitation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perverse! provoking and incomprehensible!&mdash;But since you consent to
      stay, my dear, I will not quarrel with your motives: I will let them rest
      as philosophically unintelligible as you please. Be satisfied, I will
      never more accuse you of perversity in refusing me formerly; nor will I
      convict you of inconsistency for obliging me now. The being convicted of
      inconsistency I know is what you people, who pique yourselves upon being
      rational, are so afraid of. Now we <i>every-day people</i>, who make no
      pretensions to be reasonable, have no character for consistency to support&mdash;you
      cannot conceive what delightful liberty we enjoy. In lieu of whole tomes
      of casuistry, the simple phrase, 'I've changed my mind,' does our
      business. Do let me hear if you could prevail upon yourself to say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've changed my mind," said Caroline, playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's candid&mdash;now I love as well as admire you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be entirely candid, then," said Caroline, "I must, my dear Lady Jane,
      if you will give me leave, tell you more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As much as you please," said Lady Jane, "for I am naturally curious,
      particularly when young ladies blush."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline thought, that however Lady Jane and she might differ on some
      points, her ladyship's anxiety to promote her happiness, in the way she
      thought most advantageous, deserved not only her gratitude but her
      confidence. Besides, it would be the most effectual way, she hoped, of
      preventing Lady Jane from forming any schemes for her establishment, to
      confess at once that she really believed it was not likely she should meet
      with any person, whose character and merits were equal to those of Count
      Altenberg, and any one inferior to him she was determined never to marry.
      She added a few words, as delicately as she could, upon the dread she felt
      of being presented in society as a young lady wishing for an
      establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane heard all she said upon this subject with much attention; but
      when she had finished, her ladyship said to herself, "Nonsense!&mdash;Every
      young lady thinks one lover perfect till she has seen another. Before
      Caroline has passed a month in fashionable society, provided she has a
      fashionable admirer, we shall hear no more of this Count Altenberg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear," said she, holding out her hand to Caroline, "I will give
      you my word I will, to the best of my ability, comply with all your
      conditions. You shall not be advertised as a young lady in search of a
      husband&mdash;but just as if you were a married woman, you will give me
      leave to introduce my acquaintance to you; and if they should find out, or
      if in time you should find out, that you are not married, you know, I
      shall not be to blame."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Behold Lady Jane Granville reinstated in her fortune, occupying a fine
      house in a fashionable situation, with suitable equipage and
      establishment! carriages rolling to her door; tickets crowding her
      servants' hands; an influx, an affluence of friends, and congratulations
      such as quite astonished Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where were these people all the time she lived in Clarges-street?"
      thought she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane, though she knew from experience the emptiness and insincerity
      of such demonstrations of regard, was, nevertheless, habitually pleased by
      them, and proud to be in a situation where numbers found it worth while to
      pay her attentions. But notwithstanding her <i>foibles</i>, she was not a
      mere fashionable friend. She was warm in her affection for Caroline. The
      <i>producing</i> her young friend in the great London world was her prime
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pretensions of individuals are often cruelly mortified when they come
      to encounter the vast competition of a capital city. As King James said to
      the country-gentleman at court, "The little vessels, that made a figure on
      the lake, appear insignificant on the ocean!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily for Caroline, she had not formed high expectations of pleasure,
      any hope of producing <i>effect</i>, or even <i>sensation</i>, upon her
      first appearance in the fashionable world. As she said in her letters to
      her friends at home, nothing could be more dull or tiresome than her first
      experience of a young lady's introduction into life; nothing, as she
      assured Rosamond, could be less like the reality than the delightful
      representations in novels, where every day produces new scenes, new
      adventures, and new characters. She was ashamed to write such stupid
      letters from London; but unless she were to have recourse to invention,
      she literally had not any thing entertaining to tell. She would, if
      Rosamond was in despair, invent a few conquests; and like great
      historians, put in some fine speeches supposed to have been spoken by
      celebrated characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality, Caroline's beauty had not passed so completely unobserved as
      her modesty and inexperience imagined. She did not know the signs of the
      times. On her first entrance into a public room eyes turned upon her&mdash;the
      eyes of mothers with apprehension, of daughters with envy. Some gentlemen
      looked with admiration, others with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A new face! Who is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A relation of Lady Jane Granville."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know&mdash;nothing, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, certainly&mdash;a daughter of the Percy who lost his fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      All apprehensions ceased on the part of the ladies, and generally all
      admiration on the part of the gentlemen. Opera-glasses turned another way.
      Pity succeeding to envy, a few charitably disposed added, "Ah! poor thing!
      unprovided for&mdash;What a pity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you dance to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does our quadrille come next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Some gentleman, an abstract admirer of beauty, perhaps, asked the honour
      of her hand&mdash;to dance; but there the abstraction generally ended. A
      few, indeed, went farther, and swore that she was a fine girl, prophesied
      that she would <i>take</i>, and declared they would be d&mdash;&mdash;d if
      they would not <i>think</i> of her, if they could afford it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From their prophecies or their oaths nothing ensued, and even the
      civilities and compliments she received from Lady Jane's particular
      friends and acquaintance, though in a more polite style, were equally
      unmeaning and unproductive. Days passed without leaving a trace behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unluckily for Caroline, her brother Alfred was about this time obliged to
      leave town. He was summoned to the country by Dr. Leicester. Dr. Percy was
      so continually employed, that she could scarcely have a few minutes in a
      week of his company, now that Lady Jane's health no longer required his
      professional attendance. Caroline, who had always been used to domestic
      society and conversation, was thus compelled to live completely in public,
      without the pleasures of home, and without the amusement young people
      generally enjoy in company, when they are with those of their own age to
      whom they can communicate their thoughts. Lady Jane Granville was so much
      afraid of Caroline's not appearing fashionable, that she continually
      cautioned her against expressing her natural feelings at the sight of any
      thing new and surprising, or at the perception of the tiresome or
      ridiculous. Her ladyship would never permit her protégée to ask the name
      of any person in public places or at private parties&mdash;because not to
      know certain people "argues yourself unknown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you who every body is when we go home;" but when she was at
      home, Lady Jane was generally too much tired to explain or to comprehend
      the description of these nameless bodies; and even when her ladyship was
      able to satisfy her curiosity, Caroline was apt to mistake afterwards the
      titles and histories of the personages, and by the misnomers of which she
      was guilty, provoked Lady Jane past endurance. Whether it was from want of
      <i>natural genius</i> in the scholar, or interest in the study, or from
      the teacher's thus unphilosophically separating the name and the idea, it
      is certain that Caroline made but slow progress in acquiring her
      fashionable nomenclature. She was nearly in despair at her own want of
      memory, when fortunately a new instructress fell in her way, who was
      delighted with her ignorance, and desired nothing better than to tell her
      who was who; in every private party and public place to point out the
      ridiculous or notorious, and at the moment the figures were passing,
      whether they heard or not, to relate anecdotes characteristic and
      illustrative: this new, entertaining preceptress was Lady Frances
      Arlington. Her ladyship having quarrelled with Miss Georgiana Falconer,
      hated to go out with Mrs. Falconer, hated still more to stay at home with
      the old tapestry-working duchess her aunt, and was delighted to have Lady
      Jane Granville to take her every where. She cared little what any person
      thought of herself, much less what they thought of Caroline: therefore,
      free from all the delicacies and anxieties of Lady Jane's friendship and
      systems, Lady Frances, though from different premises coming to the same
      conclusion, agreed that thinking of Caroline's advantage was <i>stuff</i>!
      and that all she had to do was to amuse herself in town. Caroline was the
      most convenient companion to go out with, for she never crossed her
      ladyship about partners, or admirers, never vied with her for admiration,
      or seemed to mind her <i>flirtations</i>; but quietly suffering her to
      draw off all the fashionable beaux, whom Lady Jane stationed upon duty,
      she let Lady Frances Arlington talk, or dance, to her heart's content, and
      was satisfied often to sit still and be silent. The variety of words and
      ideas, facts and remarks, which her lively and practised companion poured
      into her mind, Caroline was left to class for herself, to generalize, and
      to make her own conclusions. Now she had means of amusement, she took
      pleasure in observing all that was going on, and she knew something of the
      characters and motives of the actors in such different scenes. As a
      spectator, she was particularly struck by the eagerness of all the
      players, at their different games of love, interest, or ambition; and in
      various sets of company, she was diverted by observing how each thought
      themselves the whole world: here a party of young ladies and gentlemen,
      practising, morning, noon, and night, steps for their <i>quadrille</i>;
      and while they are dancing the <i>quadrille</i>, jockey gentlemen ranged
      against the wall in the ball-room, talking of their horses; grave heads
      and snuff-boxes in a corner settling the fate of Europe, proving that,
      they were, are, or ought to be, behind the scenes; at the card-tables,
      sharpened faces seeing nothing in the universe but their cards; and at the
      piano-forte a set of signers and signoras, and ladies of quality, mingled
      together, full of duets, solos, overtures, cavatinas, expression,
      execution, and thorough bass&mdash;mothers in agonies, daughters pressed
      or pressing forward&mdash;some young and trembling with shame&mdash;more,
      though young, yet confident of applause&mdash;others, and these the
      saddest among the gay, veteran female exhibitors, tired to death, yet
      forced to continue the unfruitful glories. In one grand party, silence and
      state; in another group, rival matrons chasing round the room the heir
      presumptive to a dukedom, or wedging their daughters closer and closer to
      that door-way through which Lord William * * * * * must pass. Here a poet
      acting enthusiasm with a <i>chapeau bras</i>&mdash;there another dying of
      ennui to admiration; here a wit cutting and slashing right or wrong; there
      a man of judgment standing by, silent as the grave&mdash;all for
      notoriety. Whilst others of high rank, birth, or wealth, without effort or
      merit, secure of distinction, looked down with sober contempt upon the
      poor stragglers and wranglers for fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline had as yet seen but few of the literary candidates for celebrity;
      only those privileged few, who, combining the pretensions of rank and
      talent, had a natural right to be in certain circles; or those who,
      uniting superior address to superior abilities, had risen or forced their
      way into fine company. Added to these were two or three, who were invited
      to parties as being the wonder and show of the season&mdash;persons whom
      the pride of rank found it gratifying to have at command, and who afforded
      to them a most happy relief from the dulness of their habitual existence.
      Caroline, though pitying the exhibitors, whenever she met any of this
      description, had great curiosity, to see more of literary society; but
      Lady Jane systematically hung back on this point, and evaded her promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear, I did promise to take you to Lady Angelica Headingham's,
      and Lady Spilsbury's, but there's time enough&mdash;not yet&mdash;not till
      I have established you in a higher society: not for your advantage to get
      among the blue-stockings&mdash;the blue rubs off&mdash;and the least shade
      might ruin you with some people. If you were married, I should introduce
      you to that set with pleasure, for they entertain me vastly, and it is a
      great privation to me this winter&mdash;a long fast; but even this
      abstinence from wit I can endure for your sake, my dear Caroline&mdash;you
      are my first object. If you would take the <i>bel esprit</i> line
      decidedly&mdash;Talents you have, but not courage sufficient; and even if
      you had, you are scarce old enough: with your beauty and grace, you have a
      better chance in the circle you are in, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Frances Arlington, who thought only of her own chance of
      amusement, seconded Caroline's wish to see the literary set. Nothing could
      be more stupid, her ladyship said, than running round always in the same
      circle; for her part, she loved to see clever odd people, and though her
      aunt-duchess would not let her go to Lady Spilsbury's, yet Lady Frances
      was sure that, with Lady Jane Granville for her chaperon, she could get a
      passport for Lady Angelica Headingham's, "because Lady Angelica is a sort
      of cousin, I can't tell you how many times removed, but just as many as
      will serve my present purpose&mdash;a connexion quite near enough to prove
      her fashionable, and respectable, and all that: so, my dear Lady Jane&mdash;I'll
      ask leave," concluded Lady Frances, "and we will go next conversazione
      day."
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;Lady Jane was firm to what she believed to be for Caroline's
      interest, and she refused to take her into <i>that set</i>, and therefore
      declined the honour of chaperoning her ladyship to Lady Angelica
      Headingham's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! my dear Lady Jane, you couldn't, you wouldn't be so cruel! When I am
      dying with impatience to see my cousin make herself ridiculous, as I hear
      she does more and more every day with that Baron Wilhelmberg&mdash;Wilhelmberg,
      I said, not Altenberg&mdash;Miss Caroline Percy need not have turned her
      head so quickly. Lady Angelica's man is a German, and yours was a Pole, or
      Prussian, was not he?&mdash;Do you know, the ugliest man I ever saw in my
      life, and the handsomest, were both Poles&mdash;but they are all
      well-bred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But about Lady Angelica's German baron?" interrupted Lady Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, what sort of a person is he?" said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As unlike your Count Altenberg as possible&mdash;an oddish looking genius&mdash;oldish,
      too&mdash;like one's idea of an alchymist, or a professor, or a conjuror&mdash;like
      any thing rather than a man of fashion; but, nevertheless, since he has
      got into fashion, the ladies have all found out that he is very like a
      Roman emperor&mdash;and so he is&mdash;like <i>any</i> head on an old
      coin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how comes there to be such a value set on this head?&mdash;How came
      he into fashion?" said Lady Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible you don't know? Oh! it was when you were out of the world
      he first made the great noise&mdash;by dreaming&mdash;yes, dreaming&mdash;dreaming
      himself, and making every body else dream as he pleases; he sported last
      season a new theory of dreaming&mdash;joins practice to theory, too&mdash;very
      extraordinary&mdash;interprets all your dreams to your satisfaction, they
      say&mdash;and, quite on philosophical principles, can make you dream
      whatever he pleases. True, upon my veracity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did your ladyship ever try his skill?" said Lady Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I; for the duchess would not hear of him&mdash;but I long the more to
      know what he could make me dream. He certainly is very clever, for he was
      asked last winter everywhere. All the world ran mad&mdash;Lady Spilsbury,
      and my wise cousin, I understand, came to pulling wigs for him. Angelica
      conquered at last; you know Angelica was always a little bit of a coquette&mdash;not
      a <i>little</i> bit neither. At first, to be sure, she thought no more of
      love for the German emperor than I do this minute; but he knew how to
      coquet also&mdash;Who would have thought it?&mdash;So there were notes,
      and verses, and dreams, and interpretations, and I can't tell you what.
      But, so far, the man is no charlatan&mdash;he has made Lady Angelica dream
      the very dream he chose&mdash;the strangest, too, imaginable&mdash;that
      she is in love with him. And the interpretation is, that she will take him
      'for better for worse.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is your own interpretation, is not it, Lady Frances?" said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible there is any truth in it?" said Lady Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All true, positively, I hear. And of all things, I should like to see
      Lady Angelica and the baron face to face&mdash;tête-à-tête&mdash;or
      profile by profile, in the true Roman emperor and empress medal style."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So should I, I confess," said Lady Jane, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best or the worst of it is," continued Lady Frances, "that, after
      all, this baron bold is, I've a notion, no better than an adventurer: for
      I heard a little bird sing, that a certain ambassador hinted
      confidentially, that the Baron de Wilhelmberg would find it difficult to
      prove his sixteen quarterings. But now, upon both your honours, promise me
      you'll never mention this&mdash;never give the least confidential hint of
      it to man, woman, or child; because it might get round, spoil our sport,
      and never might I have the dear delight of drawing the caricature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Now</i> your ladyship is not serious, I am sure," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never more serious&mdash;never so serious in my life; and, I assure you,"
      cried Lady Frances, speaking very earnestly and anxiously, "if you give
      the least hint, I will never forgive you while I live; for I have set my
      heart on doing the caricature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible that, for the mere pleasure of drawing a caricature, you would
      let your own cousin expose herself with an adventurer!" said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "La! Lady Angelica is only my cousin a hundred removes. I can't help her
      being ridiculous: every body, I dare say, has ridiculous cousins&mdash;and
      laugh one must. If one were forbidden to laugh at one's relatives, it
      would be sad indeed for those who have extensive connexions. Well, Lady
      Jane, I am glad to see that <i>you</i> don't pique yourself on being too
      good to laugh: so I may depend on you. Our party for Lady Angelica's is
      fixed for Monday."
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;Lady Jane had, it is certain, some curiosity and some desire to
      laugh at her neighbour's expense. So far, Lady Frances had, with address,
      touched her foible for her purpose; but Lady Jane's affection for Caroline
      strengthened her against the temptation. She was persuaded that it would
      be a disadvantage to her to go to this conversazione. She would not upon
      any account have Miss Percy be seen in the blue-stocking set at present&mdash;she
      had her reasons. To this resolution her ladyship adhered, though Lady
      Frances Arlington, pertinacious to accomplish any purpose she took into
      her fancy, returned morning after morning to the charge. Sometimes she
      would come with intelligence from her fetcher and carrier of news, as she
      called him, Captain Nuttall.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, with a very dejected countenance, her ladyship came in saying,
      "It's off&mdash;it's all off! Nuttall thinks it will never be a match."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, in high spirits, she brought word, "It's on&mdash;it's on
      again! Nuttall thinks it will certainly be a match&mdash;and Angelica is
      more delightfully ridiculous than ever! Now, my dear Lady Jane, Tuesday?&mdash;next
      week?&mdash;the week afterwards? In short, my dearest Lady Jane, once for
      all, will you ever take me to her conversazione?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, my dear Lady Frances, till Miss Caroline Percy is married," said
      Lady Jane: "I have my own reasons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I wish Miss Caroline Percy were to be married to-morrow&mdash;I have
      my own reasons. But, after all, tell me, is there any, the least chance of
      Miss Percy's being married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the least chance," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is her own fault," said Lady Jane, looking mortified and displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That cannot be said of me, there's one comfort," cried Lady Frances. "If
      I'm not married, 'tis not my fault; but my papa's, who, to <i>make an
      eldest son</i>, left me only a poor 5000<i>l.</i> portion. What a shame to
      rob daughters for sons, as the grandees do! I wish it had pleased Heaven
      to have made me the daughter of an honest merchant, who never thinks of
      this impertinence: then with my plum or plums, I might have chosen the
      first spend-thrift lord in the land, or, may be, I might have been blessed
      with an offer from that paragon of perfection, Lord William &mdash;&mdash;.
      Do you know what made him such a paragon of perfection? His elder
      brother's falling sick, and being like to die. Now, if the brother should
      recover, adieu to my Lord William's perfections."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the opinion of all," said Lady Jane. "Lord William was a favourite
      of mine, and I saw his merit long ago, and shall see it, whether his elder
      brother die or recover."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events," continued Lady Frances, "he will be a paragon, you will
      see, only till he is married, and then&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'How shall I your true love know
  From any other man?'
</pre>
    <p>
      "By-the-bye, the other day, Lord William, in flying from the chase of
      matrons, in his fright (he always looks like a frightened hare, poor
      creature!) took refuge between you two ladies. Seriously, Lady Jane, do
      you know I think you <i>manage</i> vastly well for your protégée&mdash;you
      are not so <i>broad</i> as Mrs. Falconer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Broad!</i> I beg your ladyship's pardon for repeating your word,"
      cried Lady Jane, looking quite angry, and feeling too angry to parry, as
      she usually did, with wit: "I really don't understand your ladyship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I must wish your ladyship a good morning, for I've no time or
      talents for explanation," said Lady Frances, running off, delighted to
      have produced a sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane rang for her carriage, and made no observations on what had
      passed. But in the evening she declared that she would not take Lady
      Frances Arlington out with her any more, that her ladyship's spirits were
      too much for her. "Besides, my dear Caroline, when she is with you, I
      never hear you speak a word&mdash;you leave it entirely to her ladyship.
      After all, she is, if you observe, a perfectly selfish creature."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane recollected various instances of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She merely makes a tool of me&mdash;my carriage, my servants, my time,
      myself, always to be at her service, whenever the aunt-duchess cannot, or
      will not, do her ladyship's behests. For the slightest errand she could
      devise, she would send me to the antipodes; bid me fetch her a toothpick
      from the farthest inch of the city. Well! I could pardon all the trouble
      she gives for her fancies, if she would take any trouble for others in
      return. No&mdash;ask her to do the least thing for you, and she tells you,
      she'd be very glad, but she does not know how; or, she would do it this
      minute, but that she has not time; or, she would have remembered it
      certainly, but that she forgot it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline admitted that Lady Frances was thoughtless and giddy, but she
      hoped not incurably selfish, as Lady Jane now seemed to suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, she is incurably selfish. Her childishness made me excuse her
      for a great while: I fancied she was so giddy that she could not remember
      any thing; but I find she never forgets any thing on which she has set her
      own foolish head. Giddy! I can't bear people who are too giddy to think of
      any body but themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline endeavoured to excuse her ladyship, by saying that, by all
      accounts, she had been educated in a way that must make her selfish.
      "Idolized, and spoiled, I think you told me she was?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, very likely; let her mother, or her grandmother, settle that
      account&mdash;I am not to blame, and I will not suffer for it. You know,
      if we entered like your father into the question of education, we might go
      back to Adam and Eve, and find nobody to blame but them. In the mean time,
      I will not take Lady Frances Arlington out with me any more&mdash;on this
      point I am determined; for, suppose I forgave her selfishness and
      childishness, and <i>all that</i>, why should I be subject to her
      impertinence? She has been suffered to say whatever comes into her head,
      and to think it wit. Now, as far as I am concerned, I will teach her
      better."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline, who always saw the best side of characters, pleaded her freedom
      from art and dissimulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Caroline, she is not half so free from dissimulation as you are
      from envy and jealousy. She is always in your way, and you never see it. I
      can't bear to hear you defend her, when I know she would and does
      sacrifice you at any time and at all times to her own amusement. But she
      shall not stand in your light&mdash;for you are a generous, unsuspicious
      creature. Lady Frances shall never go out with me again&mdash;and I have
      just thought of an excellent way of settling that matter. I'll change my
      coach for a vis-à-vis, which will carry only two."
    </p>
    <p>
      This Lady Jane, quick and decided, immediately accomplished; she adhered
      to her resolution, and never did take Lady Frances Arlington out with her
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning from a party this evening&mdash;a party where they met Lord
      William, who had sat beside Caroline at supper&mdash;Lady Jane began to
      reproach her with having been unusually reserved and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline said she was not conscious of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope and trust I am not too broad," continued Lady Jane, with a very
      proud and proper look; "but I own, I think there is as much indelicacy in
      a young lady's hanging back too much as in her coming too forward. And
      gentlemen are apt to over-rate their consequence as much, if they find you
      are afraid to speak to them, as if you were to talk&mdash;like Miss
      Falconer herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline assented fully to the truth of this remark; assured Lady Jane
      that she had not intentionally hung back or been reserved; that she had no
      affectation of this sort. In a word, she promised to exert herself more in
      conversation, since Lady Jane desired it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do wish it, my dear: you don't <i>get on</i>&mdash;there's no <i>getting
      you on</i>. You certainly do not talk enough to gentlemen when they sit
      beside you. It will be observed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, ma'am, I hope it will be observed too," said Caroline, smiling,
      "that the gentlemen do not talk to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter&mdash;you should find something to say to them&mdash;you have
      plenty of gold, but no ready change about you. Now, as Lord Chesterfield
      tells us, you know, that will never do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline was perfectly sensible of this&mdash;she knew she was deficient
      in the sort of conversation of the moment, requisite for fine company and
      public places.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But when I have nothing to say, is not it better for me to say nothing,
      ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear&mdash;half the world are in that predicament; but would it
      mend our condition to reduce our parties to quakers' silent meetings? My
      dear, you must condescend to talk, without saying any thing&mdash;and you
      must bear to hear and say the same words a hundred times over; and another
      thing, my dear Caroline&mdash;I wish you could cure yourself of looking
      fatigued. You will never be thought agreeable, unless you can endure,
      without showing that you are tired, the most stupid people extant&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline smiled, and said she recollected her father's telling her that
      "the Prince de Ligne, the most agreeable man of his day, declared that his
      secret depended, not on his wit or talents for conversation, but on his
      power of concealing the ennui he felt in stupid company."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, <i>I</i> tell you so, as well as the Prince de Ligne, and
      let me see that you benefit by it to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night they went to a large party at a very fine lady's. It was
      dull, but Caroline did her best to look happy, and exerted herself to talk
      to please Lady Jane, who, from her card-table, from time to time, looked
      at her, nodded and smiled. When they got into their carriage, Lady Jane,
      before she had well drawn up the glass, began to praise her for her
      performance this evening. "Really, my dear, you got on very well to-night;
      and I hear Miss Caroline Percy is very agreeable. And, shall I tell you
      who told me so?&mdash;No; that would make you too vain. But I'll leave you
      to sleep upon what has been said&mdash;to-morrow you shall hear more."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, Caroline had stolen away from visitors, and quietly in
      her own room was endeavouring to proceed in her copy of the miniature for
      Mr. Gresham, when Lady Jane came into her apartment, with a letter and its
      cover in her hand. "A letter in which you, Caroline, are deeply
      concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden hope darted across Caroline's imagination and illuminated her
      countenance. As suddenly it vanished, when she saw on the cover of the
      letter, no foreign post-mark, no foreign hand&mdash;but a hand unknown to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deeply concerned! How can I&mdash;how&mdash;how am I concerned in this,
      ma'am?" she asked&mdash;with difficulty commanding her voice to articulate
      the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only a proposal for you, my dear," said Lady Jane, smiling: "not a
      proposal for which you need blush, as you'll see if you'll read."
    </p>
    <p>
      But observing that Caroline was not at this moment capable of reading,
      without seeming to notice the tremor of her hand, and that she was holding
      the letter upside down before her eyes, Lady Jane, with kind politeness,
      passed on to the picture at which her young friend had been at work, and
      stooping to examine the miniature with her glass, made some observations
      on the painting, and gave Caroline time to recover. Nor did her ladyship
      look up till Caroline exclaimed, "John Clay!&mdash;English Clay!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;Clay, of Clay-hall, as Mrs. Falconer would say. You see, my
      love, I told you truly, it was no blushing matter. I am sorry I startled
      you by my abruptness. <i>Surprises</i> are generally ill-judged&mdash;and
      always ill-bred. Acquit me, I beseech you, of all but thoughtlessness,"
      said Lady Jane, sitting down by Caroline, and kindly taking her hand: "I
      hope you know I am not Mrs. Falconer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, indeed," said Caroline, pressing her hand: "I feel all your
      kindness, all your politeness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, I knew that a proposal from Clay, of Clay-hall, would be to
      you&mdash;just what it is to me," said Lady Jane. "I hope you cannot
      apprehend that, for the sake of his seven or ten thousand, whatever he has
      per annum, I should press such a match upon you, Caroline? No, no, you are
      worth something much better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my dear Lady Jane," cried Caroline, embracing her with warm
      gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, child, you could not think me so&mdash;merely mercenary. No; touch
      me upon family, or fashion&mdash;any of my aristocratic prejudices as your
      father calls them&mdash;and I might, perhaps, be a little peremptory. But
      John Clay is a man just risen from the ranks, lately promoted from being a
      manufacturer's son, to be a subaltern in good company, looking to rise
      another step by purchase: no, no&mdash;a Percy could not accept such an
      offer&mdash;no loss of fortune could justify such a <i>mésalliance</i>.
      Such was my first feeling, and I am sure yours, when you read at the
      bottom of this awkwardly folded epistle, 'Your ladyship's most devoted,
      &amp;c. John Clay'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I had no feeling, but pure surprise," said Caroline. "I
      scarcely think Mr. Clay can be in earnest&mdash;for, to the best of my
      recollection, he never spoke five words to me in his life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "English Clay, my dear. Has not he said every thing in one word?&mdash;I
      should have been a little surprised, but that I have been seeing this good
      while the <i>dessous des cartes</i>. Don't flatter yourself that love for
      you offers Clay-hall&mdash;no; but hatred to Mrs. and Miss Falconer. There
      have been quarrels upon quarrels, and poor Lady Trant in the middle of
      them, unable to get out&mdash;and John Clay swearing he is not to be <i>taken
      in</i>&mdash;and Miss Falconer buffeting Lady Trant with the willow he
      left on her brows&mdash;and Mrs. Falconer smiling through the whole, and
      keeping the secret, which every body knows: in short, my dear, 'tis not
      worth explaining to you&mdash;but John Clay certainly hopes to complete
      the mortification of the Falconers by giving himself to you. Besides, you
      are in fashion. Too much has been said about him&mdash;I'm tired of him.
      Write your answer, my dear&mdash;or I'm to write, am I? Well, give me some
      gilt paper&mdash;let us do the thing properly." Properly the thing was
      done&mdash;the letter folded, not awkwardly, was sealed and sent, Caroline
      delighted with Lady Jane, and Lady Jane delighted with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So there's an end of that matter," said Lady Jane. "I saw how it would be
      long ago; but I was glad you saw nothing of it, lest you should not have
      let it come to a declaration. A refusal is always creditable; therefore, I
      own, I should have been mortified, if the season had passed without your
      having one proposal. But now you have nothing to be ashamed of&mdash;you've
      killed your man&mdash;and I hope and trust I shall live to see you kill
      another."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline laughed, but said she was glad Lady Jane was not one of those who
      count refusals as so many proofs of a young lady's merit; for her own
      part, she acknowledged she was inclined to think that they were sometimes
      proofs rather of coquetry and duplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane hesitated, and said she did not see this&mdash;she could not
      agree to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation went on till her ladyship and Caroline came to a complete
      opposition of opinion on a principle, which, though it was only stated in
      general, and in the abstract, her ladyship defended with an urgency, and
      Caroline resisted with a steadiness, which are seldom shown about any
      merely speculative point, unless there is some secret apprehension of
      their being soon reduced to practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane asserted that "a woman should always let an attachment come to a
      declaration, before she permits a man to see her mind, even though
      determined upon a refusal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline thought this would be using the man ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane maintained that it would be using him much worse to refuse him
      before he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But without refusing," Caroline said that "a gentleman might be led to
      perceive when he was not likely to be accepted, and thus would be saved
      the pain and humiliation of a rejected proposal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not a young lady's first business to think of that&mdash;her first
      duty was to do what was right and proper for herself," Lady Jane said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly; but the very question is, what is right and proper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To give a distinct answer when a distinct question is asked, neither more
      nor less," said Lady Jane. "Caroline, on these subjects you must trust to
      one who knows the world, to tell you the opinion of the world. A woman is
      safe, and cannot be blamed by friend or foe, if she adhere to the plain
      rule, 'Stay till you are asked.' Till a gentleman thinks proper, in form,
      to declare his attachment, nothing can be more indelicate than for a lady
      to see it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or, in some cases, more disingenuous, more cruel, than to pretend to be
      blind to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cruel!&mdash;Cruel is a word of the last century, or the century before
      the last. Cruelty is never heard of now, my dear&mdash;gentlemen's hearts
      don't break in these our days; or suppose an odd heart should break, if
      the lady is treating it according to rule, she is not to blame. Why did
      not the proud tongue speak? Whatever happens, she is acquitted by the
      world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And by her own conscience? Surely not, if she deceive, and injure by
      deception."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane warmly repeated that she knew the world&mdash;that at her time
      of life she ought to know the world&mdash;and that she was certain any
      line of conduct but that which she had pointed out would expose a woman to
      the charge of indelicacy, and perhaps of impertinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were heavy charges, Caroline felt; but she thought that, when not
      deserved, they could be borne better than self-reproaches for the want of
      candour and truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane observed, that, in the catalogue of female virtues, delicacy
      must have the foremost place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline made a distinction between real delicacy and punctilio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane was inclined to call it a distinction without a difference. She,
      however, more prudently said, that punctilio was necessary as the guard of
      female delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly; but the greater virtue should not be sacrificed to the less.
      Truth and sincerity, Caroline thought, must be classed among the highest
      virtues of woman, as well as of man, and she hoped they were perfectly
      consistent with the utmost feminine modesty. She asked whether, after all,
      the plea of delicacy and punctilio was not sometimes used to conceal the
      real motives? Perhaps ladies, in pretending to be too delicate to see a
      gentleman's sentiments, were often, in fact, gratifying their own vanity,
      and urging him to that declaration which was to complete the female
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane grew angry: but, fearing lest Caroline should perceive that she
      had some particular object in view&mdash;doubtful whether Caroline knew,
      or did not know, her aim&mdash;and farther, having a secret hope, that,
      like other young ladies who support fine sentiments about love and
      generosity, in conversation, she might, when it came to the test, forget
      them, her ladyship urged her opinion no farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, she candidly acknowledged, that much might be said on Caroline's
      side of the question&mdash;and there the matter ended.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The object that Lady Jane had in view was to prevent Caroline from
      discouraging, by premature candour, a passion which she saw rising in the
      heart of a young nobleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord William &mdash;&mdash;,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Well pleased to 'scape from flattery to wit,"
</pre>
    <p>
      had always preferred Lady Jane Granville's company to the society of those
      who courted him more, or with less delicacy. Since Miss Caroline Percy's
      arrival and appearance in town Lady Jane had, to do her justice, preserved
      with his lordship exactly the same even tenor of conduct; whatever her
      wishes might be, she had too much proper pride to compromise her own or
      her young friend's dignity. Moreover, her ladyship had sense and knowledge
      of character sufficient to perceive that such a sacrifice, or the least
      appearance of a disposition to make it, would be not only degrading, but
      vain: it would, she knew, for ever disgust and ruin them in the opinion of
      a man, who had infinitely more penetration and feeling than those who
      flattered him were aware that he possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord William had excellent abilities, knowledge, and superior qualities of
      every sort, all depressed by excessive timidity, to such a degree as to be
      almost useless to himself and to others. Whenever he was, either for the
      business or pleasure of life, to meet or mix with numbers, the whole man
      was, as it were, snatched from himself. He was subject to that nightmare
      of the soul, who seats herself upon the human breast, oppresses the heart,
      palsies the will, and raises spectres of dismay, which the sufferer
      combats in vain&mdash;that cruel enchantress, who hurls her spell even
      upon childhood; and when she makes the youth her victim, pronounces,
      "Henceforward you shall never appear in your natural character: innocent,
      you shall look guilty; wise, you shall look silly; never shall you have
      the use of your natural faculties. That which you wish to say, you shall
      not say&mdash;that which you wish to do, you shall not do: you shall
      appear reserved when you are enthusiastic, insensible when your heart
      sinks into melting tenderness. In the presence of those you most wish to
      please, you shall be most awkward; and when approached by her you love,
      you shall become lifeless as a statue, under the irresistible spell of <i>mauvaise
      honte</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange that France should give a name to that malady of the mind which
      she never knew, or of which she knows less than any other nation upon the
      surface of the civilized globe! Under the spell of <i>mauvaise honte</i>
      poor Lord William&mdash;laboured&mdash;fast bound&mdash;and bound the
      faster by all the efforts made for his relief by the matrons and young
      damsels who crowded round him continually. They were astonished that all
      their charms, and all the encouragement they held out, failed to free this
      young nobleman from his excessive timidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pity! it was his only fault, they were sure."&mdash;"Ten thousand
      pities he could not be made to speak&mdash;they were certain he had a vast
      deal to say."&mdash;"And he could be so agreeable, they were confident, if
      he would."&mdash;"Most extraordinary that a man of his rank and fortune,
      whom every creature admired, should be so timid."
    </p>
    <p>
      True; but the timid Lord William all the time esteemed himself more highly
      than these ladies who affected to admire him. Mixed with his apparent
      timidity there was a secret pride. Conscious of the difference between
      what he was, and what he appeared to be, he was at once mortified and
      provoked, and felt disdain and disgust for those who pretended to admire
      his outward man, or who paid to his fortune that tribute which he thought
      due to his merit. With some few, some very few, by whom he was
      appreciated, his pride and his timidity were equally at ease, his reserve
      vanished in an astonishing manner, and the man came out of the marble. Of
      this small number in his confidence Lady Jane Granville was one. Even from
      his boyish years she had discerned his worth and value, and he now
      distinguished her by his grateful and constant regard. But Lady Jane
      Granville, though a woman of considerable talents, could not be a judge of
      the whole of his mind, or the extent of his powers: her talent was chiefly
      wit&mdash;her knowledge, knowledge of the world&mdash;her mind cultivated
      but slightly, and for embellishment&mdash;his deeply, extensively, and
      with large views. When he became acquainted with Miss Caroline Percy, he
      soon found that to her all this appeared, and by her was justly valued.
      His assiduity in cultivating his friend Lady Jane's acquaintance
      increased; and his taste for the conversation at her house became so
      great, that he was always the first, and usually the last, at her parties.
      His morning visits were frequent and long; he knew, by instinct, the hours
      when the two ladies were disengaged, but not always so exactly the time
      when he ought to take leave. His ear never informed him when Lady Jane's
      carriage came to the door, nor did he always hear the servant announce its
      being in readiness. Her ladyship might fidget as much as her politeness
      would permit without danger of its being observed. His lordship never was
      wakened to the sense of its being necessary to stir, till Miss Caroline
      Percy, by some strong indication, such as putting away her drawing, and
      the books, or by plainly saying, "We must go out now," made it manifest to
      him that he must depart. For this Caroline was regularly reproved
      afterwards by Lady Jane&mdash;but she never found that it gave Lord
      William any offence; nor did she for some time observe that it caused him
      much uneasiness. He seemed to her to stay from mere habitual absence of
      mind, and unwillingness to remove from a retreat where he was safe and
      comfortable, to some place where he was liable to be annoyed by his fair
      persecutors. That he liked her company and conversation she did not affect
      to deny, nor could she doubt that he felt for her esteem and regard&mdash;he
      expressed both, and he was not a man to express more than he felt, or the
      truth of whose professions could be suspected; but she thought that his
      regard for her, and for Lady Jane, were both of the same nature. She
      thought him a <i>friend, not a lover</i>. This was not with Caroline a
      mere commonplace phrase. She believed this to be true; and at the time she
      believed it, she was right. But constantly in the society of an amiable,
      sensible, and beautiful young woman, with a man of feeling, taste, and
      understanding, whose heart is disengaged, the passage from friendship to
      love is found so easy and rapid, as to be scarcely perceptible. And to
      this, which generally happens in similar circumstances, Lord William was
      peculiarly liable. For though, from the crowds who courted his attention,
      it might seem that his liberty of choice was unlimited, yet, in fact, his
      power of choosing was contracted and reduced to the few "whom choice and
      passion both approve." Among these few his fastidious judgment, and his
      apprehensions of domestic unhappiness, saw frequently, and sometimes too
      justly, objection to the family connexion of the young lady: some want of
      union in it&mdash;want of principle, or train of dissipation, which he
      dreaded, or some folly he disliked; so that among the numbers of his own
      rank who sought his alliance, it was not easy for him to satisfy himself,
      even as to connexion&mdash;still more difficult to satisfy him as to love,
      "the modern fair one's jest," or, what is worse, her affectation. His
      lordship was well aware that among the numbers of young ladies who were
      ready at a moment's warning to marry him, not one of these would love him
      for his own sake. Now in common with Marmontel's Alcibiades, and with most
      men of rank who have any superiority of character, Lord William had an
      anxious desire to be loved for his own sake; for though, in the opinion of
      most people of the world, and of some philosophers, the circumstances of
      rank and fortune form a part of personal merit; yet as these are not
      indissolubly associated with the individual, he rather preferred affection
      and esteem arising from merit, of which he could not be deprived by any
      revolution of fate or turn of fancy. If he were ever loved by Caroline
      Percy, it would be <i>for his own sake</i>; and of the constancy of her
      affection, if once obtained, the whole tenor of her character and conduct
      gave him the most secure pledge. Her education, manners, talents, and
      beauty, were all such as would honour and grace the highest rank of life.
      She had no fortune&mdash;but that was of no consequence to him&mdash;he
      was likely to have a princely income: he had no debts, he had at present
      all that satisfied his wishes, and that could enable him to live married,
      as well as single, in a manner that suited his station. His friends, eager
      to have him marry, and almost despairing of his complying, in this point,
      with their wishes, left him entirely at liberty in his choice. Reason and
      passion both determined on that choice, just about the time when English
      Clay proposed for Caroline, and when the conversation about declarations
      and refusals had passed between her and Lady Jane. That conversation,
      instead of changing or weakening the opinions Caroline then expressed, had
      confirmed her in her own sentiments, by drawing out more fully the
      strength of the reasons, and the honourable nature of the feelings, on
      which they were founded. Some slight circumstances, such as she could
      scarcely state in words, occurred about this time, which first gave her
      the idea, that Lord William &mdash;&mdash; felt for her more than esteem.
      The tender interest he showed one day when she had a slight indisposition&mdash;the
      extreme alarm he expressed one night when there occurred an embarrassment
      between their carriages at the door of the opera-house, by which Lady
      Jane's vis-à-vis was nearly overturned&mdash;an alarm much greater than
      Caroline thought the occasion required&mdash;was succeeded by anger
      against his coachman, so much more violent and vehement than the error or
      offence justified, or than his lordship had ever before been seen to show;
      these things, which in a man of gallantry might mean nothing but to show
      his politeness, from Lord William seemed indicative of something more.
      Caroline began to see that the friend might become a lover, and now, for
      the first time, questioned her own heart. She thought highly of Lord
      William's abilities and character&mdash;she saw, as she had once said to
      Lady Jane, "signs which convinced her that this volcano, covered with
      snow, and often enveloped in clouds, would at some time burst forth in
      torrents of fire." Little indication as Lord William now showed to common
      observers of being or of becoming an orator, she perceived in him the soul
      of eloquence; and she foresaw, that on some great occasion, from some
      great motive, he would at once vanquish his timidity, and burst forth upon
      the senate. She felt convinced that whether eloquent or silent, speaking
      or acting, in public or private life, Lord William would in every
      circumstance of trial fill and sustain the character of an upright,
      honourable, enlightened English nobleman. Notwithstanding that she thought
      thus highly of him, Count Altenberg, in her opinion, far surpassed him in
      the qualities they both possessed, and excelled in many, in which Lord
      William was deficient&mdash;in manner especially; and manner goes a great
      way in love, even with people of the best understanding. Besides all the
      advantages of manner, Count Altenberg had far superior talents, or at
      least far superior habits of conversation&mdash;he was altogether as
      estimable and more agreeable than his rival. He also had had the advantage
      of finding Caroline's mind disengaged&mdash;he had cultivated her society
      in the country, where he had had time and opportunity to develope his own
      character and hers&mdash;in one word, he had made the first impression on
      her heart; and such an impression, once made on a heart like hers, cannot
      be easily effaced. Though there seemed little chance of his returning to
      claim his place in her affections&mdash;though she had made the most
      laudable efforts to banish him from her recollection, yet
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "En songeant qu'il faut qu'on l'oublie
  On s'en souvient;"
</pre>
    <p>
      and now she found, that not only all others compared with him were
      indifferent to her, but that any, whom she was forced to put in comparison
      and competition with Count Altenberg, immediately sunk in her opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus distinctly knowing her own mind, Caroline was however still in doubt
      as to Lord William's, and afraid of mistaking the nature of his
      sentiments. She well remembered Lady Jane's cautions; and though she was
      fully resolved to spare by her candour the suspense and pain which
      coquetry might create and prolong, yet it was necessary to be certain that
      she read aright, and therefore to wait for something more decisive, by
      which to interpret his meaning. Lady Jane wisely forbore all observations
      on the subject, and never said or looked a word that could recall the
      memory of her former debate. With the most scrupulous, almost haughty
      delicacy, and the most consummate prudence, she left things to take their
      course, secure of what the end would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night Lady Jane and Caroline were at a party. When they arrived, they
      descried Lord William, in the midst of a group of the fair and
      fashionable, looking as if he was suffering martyrdom. His eye caught
      Caroline as she passed, and his colour changed. The lady next him put up
      her glass, to look for the cause of that change&mdash;but the glass was
      put down again, and no apprehensions excited. By degrees, Lord William
      worked his way towards Caroline&mdash;no, not towards Caroline, but to
      Lady Jane Granville. The company near her were talking of a proposal,
      which a gentleman had lately made for a celebrated beauty&mdash;his suit
      had been rejected. Some said that the lady must have seen that he was
      attached to her, and that she had been to blame in allowing him so long to
      pay her attentions, if she were determined to refuse him at last; others
      defended the lady, saying that the gentleman had never made a distinct
      declaration, and that therefore the lady was quite correct in not
      appearing to know that his intentions meant any thing more than was
      avowed. Lord William listened, perfectly silent, and with an appearance of
      some anxiety. Lady Jane Granville supported warmly the same side of the
      question which she had taken in a similar conversation with Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Percy was appealed to for her opinion, "Would it not be strange,
      indeed, if a lady were to reject a gentleman before she was asked?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord William with increasing anxiety listened, but dared not look at
      Caroline, who with becoming modesty, but with firmness in what she
      believed to be right, answered, "that if a woman saw that a gentleman
      loved her, and felt that she could not return his attachment, she might,
      without any rude or premature rejecting, simply by a certain ease of
      manner, which every man of sense knows how to interpret, mark the
      difference between esteem and tenderer sentiments; and might, by
      convincing him that there was no chance of his obtaining any farther
      interest in her heart, prevent his ever having the pain of a decided
      refusal."
    </p>
    <p>
      The discussion ended here. Fresh company joined them; other subjects were
      started. Lord William continued silent: he did not take any share in any
      conversation, but was so absent and absorbed in his own thoughts, that
      several times he was spoken to, without his being able to give a plausible
      answer&mdash;then he stood covered with confusion&mdash;confusion
      increasing from the sense that it was observed, and could not be
      conquered. The company moved different ways, but his lordship continued
      fixed near Caroline. At last the attention of all near him was happily
      diverted and drawn away from him by the appearance of some new and
      distinguished person. He seized the moment, and summoned courage
      sufficient to address some slight question to Caroline: she answered him
      with an ease of manner which he felt to be unfavourable to his wishes. The
      spell was upon him, and he could not articulate&mdash;a dead silence might
      have ensued, but that Lady Jane happily went on saying something about
      pine-apple ice. Lord William assented implicitly, without knowing to what,
      and replied, "Just so&mdash;exactly so&mdash;" to contradictory
      assertions; and if he had been asked at this instant whether what he was
      eating was hot or cold, he could not have been able to decide. Lady Jane
      composedly took a biscuit, and enjoyed the passing scene, observing that
      this was the pleasantest party she had been at this season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crabstock came up, and Lady Jane, with wit at will, kept the
      pattern-lady in play by an opportunely-recollected tale of scandal; with
      ears delighted, eyes riveted, stood Mrs. Crabstock, while Lord William,
      again relieved from the fear of observation, breathed once more; and,
      partly recovering his senses, through the mist that hung over him, looked
      at Caroline, in hopes of drawing some encouraging omen from her
      countenance. He had come to this party determined to say something that
      should explain to her his sentiments. He thought he could speak to her
      better in a crowd than alone. Now or never! said he to himself. With
      desperate effort, and with an oppressed voice, he said&mdash;the very
      thing he did not mean to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Percy, I never was so inclined in all my life to quarrel with ease
      of manner in any body as in you." Then, correcting himself, and blushing
      deeply, he added, "I don't mean that I don't admire your ease of manner in
      general&mdash;but&mdash;in short, it is impossible, I think, that with
      your penetration, you can be in any doubt as to my sentiments. If I
      thought&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short: he felt as if his life hung upon a thread&mdash;as if
      the first look, the first sound of her voice, the next word spoken, must
      decide his fate. He longed, yet feared to see that look, and to hear that
      word. "And I think it is impossible that, with your lordship's
      penetration, you should mistake mine," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an ingenuous sweetness in her look and voice, a fear of giving
      pain, yet a resolution to be sincere. Lord William felt and understood it
      all. He saw there was no hope. Caroline heard from him a deep sigh. With
      great and painful emotion, in the most calm voice she could command, but
      in the kindest tone, she added, "For the sentiments of regard and esteem
      your lordship has expressed for me, believe me, I am truly grateful."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crabstock moved towards them, and Caroline paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you to be at Lady Arrowsmith's concert to-morrow, my lord?" said Mrs.
      Crabstock, who was now at liberty to ask questions; for even scandal will
      not hold curiosity in check for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you to be at Lady Arrowsmith's, my lord, to-morrow night?" repeated
      she, for her first attack was unheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know, indeed," said he, starting from his fit of absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crabstock persisted. "Were you at the opera last night, my lord?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really, ma'am, do not recollect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me!" cried Mrs. Crabstock.
    </p>
    <p>
      And "Bless me!" cried Lady Jane Granville. "We are to be at the Duchess of
      Greenwich's ball: Caroline, my dear&mdash;time for us to move. My lord,
      might I trouble your lordship to ask if our carriage is to be had?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord William, before she had completed the request, obeyed. As they went
      down the staircase, Lady Jane laughing said, "I am afraid I shall be as
      impertinently curious as Mrs. Crabstock&mdash;I was going to ask your
      lordship whether you are engaged to-morrow, or whether you can come to us&mdash;to
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Unhappily</i>," the accent on the word showed it was no expression of
      course. "Unhappily I cannot&mdash;I am engaged&mdash;I thank your
      ladyship."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane looked back at Caroline, who was a little behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Though I could not recollect in time to tell Mrs. Crabstock where I was
      last night, or where I am to be to-morrow," continued his lordship, making
      an effort to smile, "yet I <i>can</i> satisfy your ladyship&mdash;I shall
      be at Tunbridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tunbridge!" cried Lady Jane, stopping short, and turning to Lord William,
      as the light shone full on his face: "Tunbridge, at this season?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All seasons are alike to me&mdash;all seasons and their change," replied
      Lord William, scarcely knowing what he answered&mdash;the powers of mind
      and body engrossed in suppressing emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now reached the bottom of the stairs&mdash;a shawl of Lady Jane's
      was not to be found; and while the servants were searching for it, she and
      Caroline, followed by Lord William, went into one of the supper-rooms,
      which was open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Tunbridge!" repeated Lady Jane. "No, my lord, you must not leave us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is there to prevent me?" said Lord William, hastily, almost harshly;
      for though at the time he felt her kindness, yet, irresistibly under the
      power of his demon, he said the thing he did not mean: his voice and look
      expressed the reverse of what his heart felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, if there is nothing to prevent your lordship," said Lady Jane,
      walking away with dignity, "I have only to wish your lordship a good
      journey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would stay, if I could see any thing to keep me," said Lord William,
      impelled, contrary to his better judgment, to appeal once more to
      Caroline's countenance. Then cursed himself for his weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane, turning back, saw his lordship's look; and now, convinced that
      Caroline was to blame for all, reproached herself for misinterpreting his
      words and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my lord," cried she, "you will not be in such haste to set out for
      Tunbridge, I am sure, as to go before you hear from me in the morning.
      Perhaps I may trouble your lordship with some commands."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed, and said he should do himself the honour of waiting her
      ladyship's commands. She passed on quickly towards the hall. Lord William
      offered his arm to Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must speak to you, Miss Percy&mdash;and have but a moment&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline walked more slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, madam&mdash;yes, I <i>do</i> thank you. Much pain you have
      given; but as little as you could. Better now than later. Like yourself&mdash;and
      I thank you for preserving the idea of excellence in my mind in all its
      integrity&mdash;in all&mdash;I shall detain you but a moment&mdash;you are
      not impatient?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Caroline, in a tremulous voice; yet for his sake, as well as
      for the sake of her own consistency, trying to suppress emotion which she
      thought he might misinterpret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fear not&mdash;I shall not misinterpret&mdash;I know too well what love
      is. Speak freely of my sentiments to Lady Jane, when I am gone&mdash;her
      friendship deserves it from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped speaking. "Stay," said Caroline. "It may give your noble mind
      some ease to know that my heart was engaged before we ever met."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent. It was the silence of deep feeling. They came within view
      of the servants&mdash;he walked quietly to the carriage&mdash;assisted her
      into it, pressed her hand&mdash;and said in a low voice, "Farewell&mdash;for
      ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage-door was shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where to, my lady?" said the footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duchess of Greenwich's, or home, Caroline?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! home, if I may choose," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Home!" said Lady Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the moment the glass was up, "Caroline, my dear, tell me this instant,
      what is all this between you and Lord William?&mdash;Is it as I hope?&mdash;or,
      is it as I fear?&mdash;speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline could not&mdash;she was in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you done?&mdash;If you have said any thing irrevocable, and
      without consulting me, I never, never will forgive you, Caroline. Speak,
      at all events."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline tried to obey her ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you done?&mdash;What have you said?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have said the truth&mdash;I have done, I hope, what I ought," said
      Caroline; "but I have given great pain&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane now perceiving by her voice that she was in sorrow, spoke no
      more in anger; but, checking herself, and changing her tone, said, "It is
      not irremediable, my dear. Whatever pain you may have given, you know the
      power to give pleasure is still in your own hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline sighed&mdash;"Alas! no, madam, it is not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so, my love? He will not leave town in the morning without my
      commands; and I am at your command. A note, a line, a word, will set all
      to rights."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that word I <i>cannot</i> say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then let me say it for you. Trust your delicacy to me&mdash;I will be
      dignity itself. Can you doubt it? Believe me, much as I wish to see you
      what and where you ought to be in society, I would not&mdash;there it is,
      begging Lady Frances Arlington's pardon, that Mrs. Falconer and I differ
      in character essentially, and <i>de fond en comble</i>. I would never
      yield a point of real delicacy; I would not descend the thousandth part of
      a degree from proper dignity, to make you&mdash;any more than to make
      myself&mdash;a princess. And now, without reserve, open your heart, and
      tell me what you wish to have done or said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, my dear Lady Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing? my dear Caroline."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no more to say&mdash;I have said all I can say."
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage stopped at their own door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are all in the dark," said Lady Jane: "when I have more light I shall
      be able better to tell what we are about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, I can see as well as hear," continued she, as her woman met her with
      lights. "Keppel, you may go to bed; we shall not want you to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Caroline, take care: remember your countenance is open to me, if not
      your heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both, both are open to you, my dear friend!" cried Caroline. "And Lord
      William, who said you deserved it from him, desired me to speak as freely
      for him as for myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a noble creature! There's the difference between reserve of
      character and reserve of manner&mdash;I always said so. Go on, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline related every thing that had passed; and Lady Jane, when she had
      finished, said, "A couple of children!&mdash;But a couple of charming
      children. Now I, that have common sense, must set it all to rights, and
      turn <i>no</i> prettily into <i>yes</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cannot be done," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, solemn fair one, it can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, my dear Lady Jane, it must not be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Children should not say <i>must</i>," cried Lady Jane, in a playful tone;
      for never did she feel in more delightful spirits than at this moment,
      when all her hopes for Caroline, as she thought, were realized; "and to
      complete '<i>the pleasing history</i>,' no obstacle remained," she said,
      "but the Chinese mother-of-pearl curtain of etiquette to be withdrawn, by
      a dexterous, delicate hand, from between Shuey-Ping-Sin and her lover."
      Lady Jane, late as it was at night, took up a pen, to write a note to Lord
      William.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do, may I ask, my dear madam?" cried Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear madam, I am going my own way&mdash;let me alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if you mean to write for me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For you!&mdash;not at all&mdash;for myself. I beg to see Lord William in
      the morning, to trouble him with my commands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But seriously, my dear Lady Jane, do not give him unnecessary pain&mdash;for
      my mind is decided."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So every young lady says&mdash;it is a ruled case&mdash;for the first
      three days." Lady Jane wrote on as fast as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Lady Jane," cried Caroline, stopping her ladyship's hand, "I am
      in earnest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, then," cried Lady Jane, impatiently, "you will not trust me&mdash;you
      will not open your heart to me, Caroline?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do&mdash;I have trusted you entirely, my dear friend. My heart I opened
      to you long ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      A dead pause&mdash;and blank consternation in Lady Jane's countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely since then it must have changed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it will change: let Lord William try to change it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline shook her head. "It will not&mdash;I cannot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you won't do this, when I ask it as a favour for my friend, my
      particular friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, dear, kind Lady Jane; I know you wish only my happiness, but
      this would make me unhappy. It is the only thing you could ask with which
      I would not comply."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll never ask any thing else while I live from you, Miss Percy,"
      cried Lady Jane, rising and throwing her pen from her. "You are resolved
      to throw your happiness from you&mdash;do so. Wish your happiness!&mdash;yes,
      I have wished it anxiously&mdash;ardently! but now I have done: you are
      determined to be perverse and philosophical. Good night to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane snatched up her candle, and in haste retired. Caroline, sensible
      that all her ladyship's anger at this moment arose from warm affection,
      was the more sorry to have occasioned it, and to feel that she could not,
      by yielding, allay it instantly.&mdash;A sleepless night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning, Keppel, half-dressed and not half awake, came, with
      her ladyship's love, and begged to speak a word to Miss Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Love!</i>" repeated Caroline, as she went to Lady Jane's apartment:
      "how kind she is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you have not slept, I see&mdash;nor I neither; but I am sure you
      have forgiven my hastiness;" said Lady Jane, raising herself on her
      pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline kissed her affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And let these tears, my dearest Caroline," continued Lady Jane, "be
      converted into tears of joy: for my sake&mdash;for your whole family&mdash;for
      your own sake, my sweet girl, be advised, and don't throw away your
      happiness for life. Here's a note from Lord William&mdash;he waits my
      commands&mdash;that's all. Let me only desire to see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my account? I cannot," said Caroline&mdash;the tears streaming down
      her face, though she spoke calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it is your pride to refuse the man for whom every other young woman
      is sighing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, believe me that I do not act from pride: I feel none&mdash;I have no
      reason to feel any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No reason to feel pride! Don't you know&mdash;yes, you know as well as I
      do, that this is the man of men&mdash;the man on whom every mother's&mdash;every
      daughter's eye is fixed&mdash;the first unmarried nobleman now in England&mdash;the
      prize of prizes. The most excellent man, you allow, and universally
      allowed to be the most agreeable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if he be not so to me?" said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That can only be because&mdash;you are conscious of the cause, Caroline&mdash;it
      is your own fault."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And therefore I said, that I felt I had no reason to be proud," said
      Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then have reason to be proud; conquer this weakness, and then you may
      have cause to be proud. You pique yourself on being reasonable: is it
      reasonable to leave your affections in the possession of a man, of whom,
      in all human probability, you will never hear more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too probable," said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And will you, Caroline Percy, like Lady Angelica Headingham, leave your
      heart at the mercy of a foreign <i>adventurer</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! stop, ma'am," cried Caroline, putting her hand before Lady Jane's
      mouth: "don't say that word&mdash;any thing else I could bear. But if you
      knew him&mdash;education, character, manners&mdash;no, you would not be so
      unjust."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know you told me you were sensible you ought not to indulge such a
      weakness, Caroline?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did&mdash;I am sensible of it&mdash;oh! you see I am; and my best&mdash;my
      very best have I done to drive him from my memory; and never, till I was
      forced to make this comparison, did I recollect&mdash;did I feel&mdash;Weak,
      I may be," said Caroline, changing from great agitation to perfect
      decision; "but wicked will not be: I will never marry one man, and love
      another. My own happiness if I sacrifice, mine be the consequence; but
      will never injure the happiness of another. Do not, madam, keep that noble
      heart, this excellent Lord William, in suspense&mdash;What are your
      commands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My commands!" cried Lady Jane, raising her voice, trembling with anger.
      "Then this is your gratitude&mdash;this your generosity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot be generous&mdash;I must be just. I have concealed nothing from
      Lord William&mdash;he knows that my heart was engaged before we met."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this your affection for all your friends&mdash;all who wish for your
      happiness? You would sacrifice nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;no, not the
      slightest fancy, disgraceful fancy of your own, to please them, when you
      know how ardently too they wish to see you happily married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To marry to please others, against my own inclination, against my own
      conscience, must be weakness indeed&mdash;self-deception; for if my
      friends wish my happiness, and I make myself miserable, how can that
      please them? Any sacrifice I could make, except that of principle, I
      would; but that I never will make, nor will my friends, nor do they,
      desire it&mdash;Forgive me, dear Lady Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never will forgive you," interrupted Lady Jane. "Ring!&mdash;yes, ring
      the bell&mdash;and when rung, never expect my forgiveness."
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be done, thought Caroline, sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My compliments, Keppel, to Lord William," said Lady Jane; "I have no
      commands to trouble him with. Stay, I must find something&mdash;that
      parcel for Mrs. Baggot, Tunbridge&mdash;I must write&mdash;I cannot
      write."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With great difficulty, in the agitation of her mind and hand, Lady Jane
      wrote a few lines, and holding the note up, looked at Caroline&mdash;a
      last appeal&mdash;in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take it, Keppel&mdash;I'm sorry Lord William's servant has been kept
      waiting," cried her ladyship, and suddenly closed the curtain. Caroline
      retired softly, hoping that Lady Jane might sleep, and sleep off her
      anger; but no&mdash;the morning passed&mdash;the day passed&mdash;and the
      sun went down upon her wrath. At night she would not, she could not, go
      out any where. Caroline, alone with her, endured a terrible tête-à-tête.
      Lady Jane never spoke. Caroline tried all she could, by affectionate
      kindness of look and voice, and by contrite gentleness, to soothe her
      perturbed spirit. Lady Jane's anger admitted of no alleviation: her
      disappointment increased the more she reflected, and the more she thought
      of what others would think, if they could know it. And that they did not
      know, might never know it, (for Lady Jane was too honourable to betray
      Lord William's secret,) was an additional mortification. It was not till
      after ninety-six hours that Caroline perceived in her ladyship any change
      for the better. The first favourable symptom was her giving vent to her
      natural feelings in the following broken sentences: "After all my pains!
      When I was just thinking of writing to your father&mdash;when I might have
      carried you home in triumph, Lady William! A duke in all human probability&mdash;a
      duchess&mdash;absolutely a duchess you might have been! And such a
      well-informed&mdash;such an amiable man!&mdash;every thing your own family
      could have wished&mdash;And Rosamond!&mdash;Ah! poor Rosamond&mdash;Rosamond,
      you little know!&mdash;And nobody will ever know&mdash;no creature will
      ever be a bit the wiser. If you would have let him even come to a
      declaration&mdash;properly, decently to a declaration&mdash;let him attend
      you in public once or twice, your declared admirer&mdash;what harm could
      it possibly have done him, you, or any body? Then there would have been
      some credit, at least&mdash;and some comfort to me. But now, at the end of
      the campaign, just where we were before! The season over, under Lady Jane
      Granville's <i>chaperonage</i>, the beautiful Miss Caroline Percy has
      received one proposal and a quarter!&mdash;No, while I live, I will never
      forgive it."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
